anarchist emile armand 18721962 who propounded the virtues of free love in the parisian anarchist milieu of the early 20th century an important current within anarchism is free love free love advocates sometimes traced their roots back to josiah warren and to experimental communities viewed sexual freedom as a clear direct expression of an individuals sovereignty free love particularly stressed womens rights since most sexual laws discriminated against women for example marriage laws and antibirth control measures the most important american free love journal was lucifer the lightbearer 18831907 edited by moses harman and lois waisbrooker but also there existed ezra heywood and angela heywoods the word 18721890 18921893 free society 18951897 as the firebrand 18971904 as

socialists advocated selfrealisation and pleasure for women and also men in the here and now they encouraged playing with sexual roles and sexuality and the openly bisexual radical edna st vincent millay and the lesbian anarchist margaret anderson were prominent among them discussion groups organised by the villagers were frequented by emma goldman among others magnus hirschfeld noted in 1923 that goldman has campaigned boldly and steadfastly for individual rights and especially for those deprived of their rights thus it came about that she was the first and only woman indeed the first and only american to take up the defence of homosexual love before the general public in fact before goldman heterosexual anarchist robert reitzel 18491898 spoke positively of homosexuality from the beginning of the 1890s in his detroitbased german language journal der arme teufel english the poor devil in argentina anarchafeminist virginia bolten published the newspaper called english the womans voice which was published nine times in rosario between 8 january 1896 and 1 january 1897 and was revived briefly in 1901 in europe the main propagandist of free love within individualist anarchism was emile armand he proposed the concept of la camaraderie amoureuse to speak of free love as the possibility of voluntary sexual encounter between consenting adults he was also a consistent proponent of polyamory in germany the stirnerists adolf brand and john henry mackay were pioneering campaigners for the acceptance of male bisexuality and homosexuality mujeres libres was an anarchist womens organisation in spain that aimed to empower working class women it was founded in 1936 by lucía sánchez saornil mercedes comaposada and amparo poch y gascón and had approximately 30000 members the organisation was based on the idea of a double struggle for womens liberation and social revolution and argued that the two objectives were equally important and should be pursued in parallel in order to gain mutual support they created networks of women anarchists lucía sánchez saornil was a main founder of the spanish anarchafeminist federation mujeres libres who was open about her lesbianism she was published in a variety of literary journals where working under a male pen name she was able to explore lesbian themes at a time when homosexuality was criminalised and subject to censorship and punishment more recently the british anarchopacifist alex comfort gained notoriety during the sexual revolution for writing the bestseller sex manual the joy of sex the issue of free love has a dedicated treatment in the work of french anarchohedonist philosopher michel onfray in such works as théorie du corps amoureux pour une érotique solaire 2000 and linvention du plaisir fragments cyréaniques 2002 libertarian education and freethought francesc ferrer i guàrdia catalan anarchist pedagogue and freethinker for english anarchist william godwin education was the main means by which change would be achieved godwin saw that the main goal of education should be the promotion of happiness for godwin education had to have a respect for the childs autonomy which precluded any form of coercion a pedagogy that respected this and sought to build on the childs own motivation and initiatives and a concern about the childs capacity to resist an ideology transmitted through the school in his political justice he criticises state sponsored schooling on account of its obvious alliance with national government early american anarchist josiah warren advanced alternative education experiences in the libertarian communities he established max stirner wrote in 1842 a long essay on education called the false principle of our education in it stirner names his educational principle personalist explaining that selfunderstanding consists in hourly selfcreation education for him is to create free men sovereign characters by which he means eternal characters who are therefore eternal because they form themselves each moment in the united states freethought was a basically antichristian anticlerical movement whose purpose was to make the individual politically and spiritually free to decide for himself on religious matters a number of contributors to liberty anarchist publication were prominent figures in both freethought and anarchism the individualist anarchist george macdonald was a coeditor of freethought and for a time the truth seeker ec walker was coeditor of the excellent freethought free love journal lucifer the lightbearer many of the anarchists were ardent freethinkers reprints from freethought papers such as lucifer the lightbearer freethought and the truth seeker appeared in liberty the church was viewed as a common ally of the state and as a repressive force in and of itself in 1901 catalan anarchist and freethinker francesc ferrer i guàrdia established modern or progressive schools in barcelona in defiance of an educational system controlled by the catholic church the schools stated goal was to educate the working class in a rational secular and noncoercive setting fiercely anticlerical ferrer believed in freedom in education education free from the authority of church and state murray bookchin wrote this period 1890s was the heyday of libertarian schools and pedagogical projects in all areas of the country where anarchists exercised some degree of influence perhaps the bestknown effort in this field was francisco ferrers modern school escuela moderna a project which exercised a considerable influence on catalan education and on experimental techniques of teaching generally la escuela moderna and ferrers ideas generally formed the inspiration for a series of modern schools in the united states cuba south america and london the first of these was started in new york city in 1911 it also inspired the italian newspaper università popolare founded in 1901 russian christian anarchist leo tolstoy established a school for peasant children on his estate tolstoys educational experiments were shortlived due to harassment by the tsarist secret police tolstoy established a conceptual difference between education and culture he thought that education is the tendency of one man to make another just like himself education is culture under restraint culture is free education is when the teaching is forced upon the pupil and when then instruction is exclusive that is when only those subjects are taught which the educator regards as necessary for him without compulsion education was transformed into culture a more recent libertarian tradition on education is that of unschooling and the free school in which childled activity replaces pedagogic approaches experiments in germany led to a s neill founding what became summerhill school in 1921 summerhill is often cited as an example of anarchism in practice however although summerhill and other free schools are radically libertarian they differ in principle from those of ferrer by not advocating an overtly political class struggleapproach in addition to organising schools according to libertarian principles anarchists have also questioned the concept of schooling per se the term deschooling was popularised by ivan illich who argued that the school as an institution is dysfunctional for selfdetermined learning and serves the creation of a consumer society instead

0,the term anarchism is a compound word composed from the word anarchy and the suffix ism themselves derived respectively from the greek ie anarchy from anarchos meaning one without rulers from the privative prefix ἀν an ie without and archos ie leader ruler cf archon or arkhē ie authority sovereignty realm magistracy and the suffix or ismos isma from the verbal infinitive suffix ίζειν izein the first known use of this word was in 1539 various factions within the french revolution labelled opponents as anarchists as robespierre did the hébertists although few shared many views of later anarchists there would be many revolutionaries of the early nineteenth century who contributed to the anarchist doctrines of the next generation such as william godwin and wilhelm weitling but they did not use the word anarchist or anarchism in describing themselves or their beliefs the first political philosopher to call himself an anarchist was pierrejoseph proudhon marking the formal birth of anarchism in the midnineteenth century since the 1890s and beginning in france the term libertarianism has often been used as a synonym for anarchism and was used almost exclusively in this sense until the 1950s in the united states its use as a synonym is still common outside the united states on the other hand some use libertarianism to refer to individualistic freemarket philosophy only referring to freemarket anarchism as libertarian anarchism
0,consistent with anarchist values is a controversial subject among anarchists anarchism is a philosophy that embodies many diverse attitudes tendencies and schools of thought as such disagreement over questions of values ideology and tactics is common the compatibility of capitalism nationalism and religion with anarchism is widely disputed similarly anarchism enjoys complex relationships with ideologies such as marxism communism collectivism syndicalismtrade unionism and capitalism anarchists may be motivated by humanism divine authority enlightened selfinterest veganism or any number of alternative ethical doctrines phenomena such as civilisation technology eg within anarchoprimitivism and the democratic process may be sharply criticised within some anarchist tendencies and simultaneously lauded in others on a tactical level while propaganda of the deed was a tactic used by anarchists in the 19th century eg the nihilist movement some contemporary anarchists espouse alternative direct action methods such as nonviolence countereconomics and antistate cryptography to bring about an anarchist society about the scope of an anarchist society some anarchists advocate a global one while others do so by local ones the diversity in anarchism has led to widely different use of identical terms among different anarchist traditions which has led to many definitional concerns in anarchist theory
0,origins woodcut from a diggers document by william everard the earliest anarchist themes can be found in the 6th century bc among the works of taoist philosopher laozi and in later centuries by zhuangzi and bao jingyan zhuangzis philosophy has been described by various sources as anarchist zhuangzi wrote a petty thief is put in jail a great brigand becomes a ruler of a nation diogenes of sinope and the cynics and their contemporary zeno of citium the founder of stoicism also introduced similar topics jesus is sometimes considered the first anarchist in the christian anarchist tradition georges lechartier wrote that the true founder of anarchy was jesus christ and the first anarchist society was that of the apostles in early islamic history some manifestations of anarchic thought are found during the islamic civil war over the caliphate where the kharijites insisted that the imamate is a right for each individual within the islamic society the french renaissance political philosopher étienne de la boétie wrote in his most famous work the discourse on voluntary servitude what some historians consider an important anarchist precedent the radical protestant christian gerrard winstanley and his group the diggers are cited by various authors as proposing anarchist social measures in the 17th century in england the term anarchist first entered the english language in 1642 during the english civil war as a term of abuse used by royalists against their roundhead opponents by the time of the french revolution some such as the enragés began to use the term positively in opposition to jacobin centralisation of power seeing revolutionary government as oxymoronic by the turn of the 19th century the english word anarchism had lost its initial negative connotation modern anarchism emerged from the secular or religious thought of the enlightenment particularly jeanjacques rousseaus arguments for the moral centrality of freedom as part of the political turmoil of the 1790s in the wake of the french revolution william godwin developed the first expression of modern anarchist thought godwin was according to peter kropotkin the first to formulate the political and economical conceptions of anarchism even though he did not give that name to the ideas developed in his work while godwin attached his anarchist ideas to an early edmund burke william godwin the first to formulate the political and economical conceptions of anarchism even though he did not give that name to the ideas developed in his work godwin is generally regarded as the founder of the school of thought known as philosophical anarchism he argued in political justice 1793 that government has an inherently malevolent influence on society and that it perpetuates dependency and ignorance he thought that the spread of the use of reason to the masses would eventually cause government to wither away as an unnecessary force although he did not accord the state with moral legitimacy he was against the use of revolutionary tactics for removing the government from power rather he advocated for its replacement through a process of peaceful evolution his aversion to the imposition of a rulesbased society led him to denounce as a manifestation of the peoples mental enslavement the foundations of law property rights and even the institution of marriage he considered the basic foundations of society as constraining the natural development of individuals to use their powers of reasoning to arrive at a mutually beneficial method of social organisation in each case government and its institutions are shown to constrain the development of our capacity to live wholly in accordance with the full and free exercise of private judgement the french pierrejoseph proudhon is regarded as the first selfproclaimed anarchist a label he adopted in his groundbreaking work what is property published in 1840 it is for this reason that some claim proudhon as the founder of modern anarchist theory he developed the theory of spontaneous order in society where organisation emerges without a central coordinator imposing its own idea of order against the wills of individuals acting in their own interests his famous quote on the matter is liberty is the mother not the daughter of order in what is property proudhon answers with the famous accusation property is theft in this work he opposed the institution of decreed property propriété where owners have complete rights to use and abuse their property as they wish he contrasted this with what he called possession or limited ownership of resources and goods only while in more or less continuous use later however proudhon added that property is liberty and argued that it was a bulwark against state power his opposition to the state organised religion and certain capitalist practices inspired subsequent anarchists and made him one of the leading social thinkers of his time the anarchocommunist joseph déjacque was the first person to describe himself as libertarian unlike pierrejoseph proudhon he argued that it is not the product of his or her labour that the worker has a right to but to the satisfaction of his or her needs whatever may be their nature in 1844 in germany the posthegelian philosopher max stirner published the book the ego and its own which would later be considered an influential early text of individualist anarchism french anarchists active in the 1848 revolution included anselme bellegarrigue ernest coeurderoy joseph déjacque and pierre joseph proudhon first international and the paris commune anarchist mikhail bakunin opposed the marxist aim of dictatorship of the proletariat in favour of universal rebellion and allied himself with the federalists in the first international before his expulsion by the marxists in europe harsh reaction followed the revolutions of 1848 during which ten countries had experienced brief or longterm social upheaval as groups carried out nationalist uprisings after most of these attempts at systematic change ended in failure conservative elements took advantage of the divided groups of socialists anarchists liberals and nationalists to prevent further revolt in spain ramón de la sagra established the anarchist journal el porvenir in la coruña in 1845 which was inspired by proudhons ideas the catalan politician francesc pi i margall became the principal translator of proudhons works into spanish and later briefly became president of spain in 1873 while being the leader of the democratic republican federal party according to george woodcock these translations were to have a profound and lasting effect on the development of spanish anarchism after 1870 but before that time proudhonian ideas as interpreted by pi already provided much of the inspiration for the federalist movement which sprang up in the early 1860s according to the encyclopædia britannica during the spanish revolution of 1873 pi y margall attempted to establish a decentralised or cantonalist political system on proudhonian lines in 1864 the international workingmens association sometimes called the first international united diverse revolutionary currents including french followers of proudhon blanquists philadelphes english trade unionists socialists and social democrats due to its links to active workers movements the international became a significant organisation karl marx became a leading figure in the international and a member of its general council proudhons followers the mutualists opposed marxs state socialism advocating political abstentionism and small property holdings woodcock also reports that the american individualist anarchists lysander spooner and william b greene had been members of the first international in 1868 following their unsuccessful participation in the league of peace and freedom lpf russian revolutionary mikhail bakunin and his collectivist anarchist associates joined the first international which had decided not to get involved with the lpf they allied themselves with the federalist socialist sections of the international who advocated the revolutionary overthrow of the state and the collectivisation of property at first the collectivists worked with the marxists to push the first international in a more revolutionary socialist direction subsequently the international became polarised into two camps with marx and bakunin as their respective figureheads mikhail bakunin characterised marxs ideas as centralist and predicted that if a marxist party came to power its leaders would simply take the place of the ruling class they had fought against anarchist historian george woodcock reports that the annual congress of the international had not taken place in 1870 owing to the outbreak of the paris commune and in 1871 the general council called only a special conference in london one delegate was able to attend from spain and none from italy while a technical excuse that they had split away from the fédération romande was used to avoid inviting bakunins swiss supporters thus only a tiny minority of anarchists was present and the general councils resolutions passed almost unanimously most of them were clearly directed against bakunin and his followers in 1872 the conflict climaxed with a final split between the two groups at the hague congress where bakunin and james guillaume were expelled from the international and its headquarters were transferred to new york in response the federalist sections formed their own international at the st imier congress adopting a revolutionary anarchist programme the paris commune was a government that briefly ruled paris from 18 march more formally from 28 march to 28 may 1871 the commune was the result of an uprising in paris after france was defeated in the francoprussian war anarchists participated actively in the establishment of the paris commune they included louise michel the reclus brothers and eugene varlin the latter murdered in the repression afterwards as for the reforms initiated by the commune such as the reopening of workplaces as cooperatives anarchists can see their ideas of associated labour beginning to be realised moreover the communes ideas on federation obviously reflected the influence of proudhon on french radical ideas indeed the communes vision of a communal france based on a federation of delegates bound by imperative mandates issued by their electors and subject to recall at any moment echoes bakunins and proudhons ideas proudhon like bakunin had argued in favour of the implementation of the binding mandate in 1848 and for federation of communes thus both economically and politically the paris commune was heavily influenced by anarchist ideas george woodcock states organised labour the antiauthoritarian sections of the first international were the precursors of the anarchosyndicalists seeking to replace the privilege and authority of the state with the free and spontaneous organization of labour in 1886 the federation of organized trades and labor unions fotlu of the united states and canada unanimously set 1 may 1886 as the date by which the eighthour work day would become standard a sympathetic engraving by walter crane of the executed anarchists of chicago after the haymarket affair the haymarket affair is generally considered the most significant event for the origin of international may day observances in response unions across the united states prepared a general strike in support of the event on 3 may in chicago a fight broke out when strikebreakers attempted to cross the picket line and two workers died when police opened fire upon the crowd the next day 4 may anarchists staged a rally at chicagos haymarket square a bomb was thrown by an unknown party near the conclusion of the rally killing an officer in the ensuing panic police opened fire on the crowd and each other seven police officers and at least four workers were killed eight anarchists directly and indirectly related to the organisers of the rally were arrested and charged with the murder of the deceased officer the men became international political celebrities among the labour movement four of the men were executed and a fifth committed suicide prior to his own execution the incident became known as the haymarket affair and was a setback for the labour movement and the struggle for the eighthour day in 1890 a second attempt this time international in scope to organise for the eighthour day was made the event also had the secondary purpose of memorialising workers killed as a result of the haymarket affair although it had initially been conceived as a onceoff event by the following year the celebration of international workers day on may day had become firmly established as an international workers holiday in 1907 the international anarchist congress of amsterdam gathered delegates from 14 different countries among which important figures of the anarchist movement including errico malatesta pierre monatte luigi fabbri benoît broutchoux emma goldman rudolf rocker and christiaan cornelissen various themes were treated during the congress in particular concerning the organisation of the anarchist movement popular education issues the general strike or antimilitarism a central debate concerned the relation between anarchism and syndicalism or trade unionism malatesta and monatte were in particular disagreement themselves on this issue as the latter thought that syndicalism was revolutionary and would create the conditions of a social revolution while malatesta did not consider syndicalism by itself sufficient he thought that the tradeunion movement was reformist and even conservative citing as essentially bourgeois and antiworker the phenomenon of professional union officials malatesta warned that the syndicalists aims were in perpetuating syndicalism itself whereas anarchists must always have anarchy as their end and consequently refrain from committing to any particular method of achieving it the spanish workers federation in 1881 was the first major anarchosyndicalist movement anarchist trade union federations were of special importance in spain the most successful was the confederación nacional del trabajo national confederation of labour cnt founded in 1910 before the 1940s the cnt was the major force in spanish working class politics attracting 158 million members at one point and playing a major role in the spanish civil war the cnt was affiliated with the international workers association a federation of anarchosyndicalist trade unions founded in 1922 with delegates representing two million workers from 15 countries in europe and latin america in latin america in particular the anarchists quickly became active in organising craft and industrial workers throughout south and central america and until the early 1920s most of the trade unions in mexico brazil peru chile and argentina were anarchosyndicalist in general outlook the prestige of the spanish cnt as a revolutionary organisation was undoubtedly to a great extent responsible for this situation the largest and most militant of these organisations was the federación obrera regional argentina it grew quickly to a membership of nearly a quarter of a million which dwarfed the rival socialdemocratic unions propaganda of the deed and illegalism italianamerican anarchist luigi galleani his followers known as galleanists carried out a series of bombings and assassination attempts from 1914 to 1932 in what they saw as attacks on tyrants and enemies of the people some anarchists such as johann most advocated publicising violent acts of retaliation against counterrevolutionaries because we preach not only action in and for itself but also action as propaganda scholars such as beverly gage contend that this was not advocacy of mass murder but targeted killings of members of the ruling class at times when such actions might garner sympathy from the population such as during periods of heightened government repression or labor conflicts where workers were killed however most himself once boasted that the existing system will be quickest and most radically overthrown by the annihilation of its exponents therefore massacres of the enemies of the people must be set in motion most is best known for a pamphlet published in 1885 the science of revolutionary warfare a howto manual on the subject of making explosives based on knowledge he acquired while working at an explosives plant in new jersey by the 1880s people inside and outside the anarchist movement began to use the slogan propaganda of the deed to refer to individual bombings regicides and tyrannicides from 1905 onwards the russian counterparts of these antisyndicalist anarchistcommunists become partisans of economic terrorism and illegal expropriations illegalism as a practice emerged and within it the acts of the anarchist bombers and assassins propaganda by the deed and the anarchist burglars individual reappropriation expressed their desperation and their personal violent rejection of an intolerable society moreover they were clearly meant to be exemplary invitations to revolt frances bonnot gang was the most famous group to embrace illegalism however as soon as 1887 important figures in the anarchist movement distanced themselves from such individual acts peter kropotkin thus wrote that year in le révolté that a structure based on centuries of history cannot be destroyed with a few kilos of dynamite a variety of anarchists advocated the abandonment of these sorts of tactics in favour of collective revolutionary action for example through the trade union movement the anarchosyndicalist fernand pelloutier argued in 1895 for renewed anarchist involvement in the labour movement on the basis that anarchism could do very well without the individual dynamiter state repression including the infamous 1894 french lois scélérates of the anarchist and labour movements following the few successful bombings and assassinations may have contributed to the abandonment of these kinds of tactics although reciprocally state repression in the first place may have played a role in these isolated acts the dismemberment of the french socialist movement into many groups and following the suppression of the 1871 paris commune the execution and exile of many communards to penal colonies favoured individualist political expression and acts numerous heads of state were assassinated between 1881 and 1914 by members of the anarchist movement including tsar alexander ii of russia president sadi carnot of france empress elisabeth of austria king umberto i of italy president william mckinley of the united states king carlos i of portugal and king george i of greece mckinleys assassin leon czolgosz claimed to have been influenced by anarchist and feminist emma goldman russian revolution and other uprisings of the 1910s nestor makhno with members of the anarchist revolutionary insurrectionary army of ukraine anarchists participated alongside the bolsheviks in both february and october revolutions and were initially enthusiastic about the bolshevik revolution however following a political falling out with the bolsheviks by the anarchists and other leftwing opposition the conflict culminated in the 1921 kronstadt rebellion which the new government repressed anarchists in central russia were either imprisoned driven underground or joined the victorious bolsheviks the anarchists from petrograd and moscow fled to ukraine there in the free territory they fought in the civil war against the whites a grouping of monarchists and other opponents of the october revolution and then the bolsheviks as part of the revolutionary insurrectionary army of ukraine led by nestor makhno who established an anarchist society in the region for a number of months expelled american anarchists emma goldman and alexander berkman were among those agitating in response to bolshevik policy and the suppression of the kronstadt uprising before they left russia both wrote accounts of their experiences in russia criticising the amount of control the bolsheviks exercised for them bakunins predictions about the consequences of marxist rule that the rulers of the new socialist marxist state would become a new elite had proved all too true the victory of the bolsheviks in the october revolution and the resulting russian civil war did serious damage to anarchist movements internationally many workers and activists saw bolshevik success as setting an example communist parties grew at the expense of anarchism and other socialist movements in france and the united states for example members of the major syndicalist movements of the cgt and iww left the organisations and joined the communist international the revolutionary wave of 191723 saw the active participation of anarchists in varying degrees of protagonism in the german uprising known as the german revolution of 19181919 which established the bavarian soviet republic the anarchists gustav landauer silvio gesell and erich mühsam had important leadership positions within the revolutionary councilist structures in the italian events known as the biennio rosso the anarchosyndicalist trade union unione sindacale italiana grew to 800000 members and the influence of the italian anarchist union 20000 members plus umanita nova its daily paper grew accordingly anarchists were the first to suggest occupying workplaces in the mexican revolution the mexican liberal party was established and during the early 1910s it led a series of military offensives leading to the conquest and occupation of certain towns and districts in baja california with the leadership of anarchocommunist ricardo flores magón in paris the dielo truda group of russian anarchist exiles which included nestor makhno concluded that anarchists needed to develop new forms of organisation in response to the structures of bolshevism their 1926 manifesto called the organisational platform of the general union of anarchists draft was supported platformist groups active today include the workers solidarity movement in ireland and the north eastern federation of anarchist communists of north america synthesis anarchism emerged as an organisational alternative to platformism that tries to join anarchists of different tendencies under the principles of anarchism without adjectives in the 1920s this form found as its main proponents volin and sebastien faure it is the main principle behind the anarchist federations grouped around the contemporary global international of anarchist federations conflicts with european fascist regimes in the 1920s and 1930s the rise of fascism in europe transformed anarchisms conflict with the state italy saw the first struggles between anarchists and fascists italian anarchists played a key role in the antifascist organisation arditi del popolo which was strongest in areas with anarchist traditions and achieved some success in their activism such as repelling blackshirts in the anarchist stronghold of parma in august 1922 the veteran italian anarchist luigi fabbri was one of the first critical theorists of fascism describing it as the preventive counterrevolution in france where the far right leagues came close to insurrection in the february 1934 riots anarchists divided over a united front policy anarchists in france and italy were active in the resistance during world war ii in germany the anarchist erich mühsam was arrested on charges unknown in the early morning hours of 28 february 1933 within a few hours after the reichstag fire in berlin joseph goebbels the nazi propaganda minister labelled him as one of those jewish subversives over the next seventeen months he would be imprisoned in the concentration camps at sonnenburg brandenburg and finally oranienburg on 2 february 1934 mühsam was transferred to the concentration camp at oranienburg when finally on the night of 9 july 1934 mühsam was tortured and murdered by the guards his battered corpse found hanging in a latrine the next morning spanish revolution in spain the national anarchosyndicalist trade union confederación nacional del trabajo initially refused to join a popular front electoral alliance and abstention by cnt supporters led to a right wing election victory but in 1936 the cnt changed its policy and anarchist votes helped bring the popular front back to power months later conservative members of the military with the support of minority extremeright parties responded with an attempted coup causing the spanish civil war 19361939 in response to the army rebellion an anarchistinspired movement of peasants and workers supported by armed militias took control of barcelona and of large areas of rural spain where they collectivised the land but even before the fascist victory in 1939 the anarchists were losing ground in a bitter struggle with the stalinists who controlled much of the distribution of military aid to the republican cause from the soviet union according to noam chomsky the communists were mainly responsible for the destruction of the spanish anarchists not just in cataloniathe communist armies mainly destroyed the collectives elsewhere the communists basically acted as the police force of the security system of the republic and were very much opposed to the anarchists partially because stalin still hoped at that time to have some kind of pact with western countries against hitler that of course failed and stalin withdrew the support to the republic they even withdrew the spanish gold reserves the events known as the spanish revolution was a workers social revolution that began during the outbreak of the spanish civil war in 1936 and resulted in the widespread implementation of anarchist and more broadly libertarian socialist organisational principles throughout various portions of the country for two to three years primarily catalonia aragon andalusia and parts of the levante much of spains economy was put under worker control in anarchist strongholds like catalonia the figure was as high as 75 but lower in areas with heavy communist party of spain influence as the sovietallied party actively resisted attempts at collectivisation enactment factories were run through worker committees agrarian areas became collectivised and run as libertarian communes anarchist historian sam dolgoff estimated that about eight million people participated directly or at least indirectly in the spanish revolution which he claimed came closer to realising the ideal of the free stateless society on a vast scale than any other revolution in history spanish communist partyled troops suppressed the collectives and persecuted both dissident marxists and anarchists the prominent italian anarchist camillo berneri who volunteered to fight against franco was killed instead in spain by gunmen associated with the spanish communist party the city of madrid was turned over to the francoist forces by the last nonfrancoist mayor of the city the anarchist melchor rodríguez garcía postwar years anarchism sought to reorganise itself after the war and in this context the organisational debate between synthesis anarchism and platformism took importance once again especially in the anarchist movements of italy and france the mexican anarchist federation was established in 1945 after the anarchist federation of the centre united with the anarchist federation of the federal district in the early 1940s the antifascist international solidarity and the federation of anarchist groups of cuba merged into the large national organisation asociación libertaria de cuba cuban libertarian association from 1944 to 1947 the bulgarian anarchist communist federation reemerged as part of a factory and workplace committee movement but was repressed by the new communist regime in 1945 in france the fédération anarchiste and the anarchosyndicalist trade union confédération nationale du travail was established in the next year while the also synthesist federazione anarchica italiana was founded in italy korean anarchists formed the league of free social constructors in september 1945 and in 1946 the japanese anarchist federation was founded an international anarchist congress with delegates from across europe was held in paris in may 1948 after world war ii an appeal in the fraye arbeter shtime detailing the plight of german anarchists and called for americans to support them by february 1946 the sending of aid parcels to anarchists in germany was a largescale operation the federation of libertarian socialists was founded in germany in 1947 and rudolf rocker wrote for its organ die freie gesellschaft which survived until 1953 in 1956 the uruguayan anarchist federation was founded in 1955 the anarchocommunist federation of argentina renamed itself as the argentine libertarian federation the syndicalist workers federation was a syndicalist group in active in postwar britain and one of solidarity federations earliest predecessors it was formed in 1950 by members of the dissolved anarchist federation of britain unlike the afb which was influenced by anarchosyndicalist ideas but ultimately not syndicalist itself the swf decided to pursue a more definitely syndicalist workercentred strategy from the outset anarchism continued to influence important literary and intellectual personalities of the time such as albert camus herbert read paul goodman dwight macdonald allen ginsberg george woodcock leopold kohr julian beck john cage and the french surrealist group led by andré breton which now openly embraced anarchism and collaborated in the fédération anarchiste anarchopacifism became influential in the antinuclear movement and anti war movements of the time as can be seen in the activism and writings of the english anarchist member of campaign for nuclear disarmament alex comfort or the similar activism of the american catholic anarchopacifists ammon hennacy and dorothy day anarchopacifism became a basis for a critique of militarism on both sides of the cold war the resurgence of anarchist ideas during this period is well documented in robert grahams anarchism a documentary history of libertarian ideas volume two the emergence of the new anarchism 19391977 contemporary anarchism squat near parc güell overlooking barcelona squatting was a prominent part of the emergence of renewed anarchist movement from the counterculture of the 1960s and 1970s on the roof occupy and resist a surge of popular interest in anarchism occurred in western nations during the 1960s and 1970s anarchism was influential in the counterculture of the 1960s and anarchists actively participated in the late sixties students and workers revolts in 1968 in carrara italy the international of anarchist federations was founded during an international anarchist conference held there in 1968 by the three existing european federations of france the fédération anarchiste the federazione anarchica italiana of italy and the iberian anarchist federation as well as the bulgarian federation in french exile in the united kingdom in the 1970s this was associated with the punk rock movement as exemplified by bands such as crass and the sex pistols the housing and employment crisis in most of western europe led to the formation of communes and squatter movements like that of barcelona spain in denmark squatters occupied a disused military base and declared the freetown christiania an autonomous haven in central copenhagen since the revival of anarchism in the mid20th century a number of new movements and schools of thought emerged although feminist tendencies have always been a part of the anarchist movement in the form of anarchafeminism they returned with vigour during the second wave of feminism in the 1960s anarchist anthropologist david graeber and anarchist historian andrej grubacic have posited a rupture between generations of anarchism with those who often still have not shaken the sectarian habits of the 19th century contrasted with the younger activists who are much more informed among other elements by indigenous feminist ecological and culturalcritical ideas and who by the turn of the 21st century formed by far the majority of anarchists around the turn of the 21st century anarchism grew in popularity and influence as part of the antiwar anticapitalist and antiglobalisation movements anarchists became known for their involvement in protests against the meetings of the world trade organization wto group of eight and the world economic forum some anarchist factions at these protests engaged in rioting property destruction and violent confrontations with police these actions were precipitated by ad hoc leaderless anonymous cadres known as black blocs other organisational tactics pioneered in this time include security culture affinity groups and the use of decentralised technologies such as the internet a significant event of this period was the confrontations at wto conference in seattle in 1999 according to anarchist scholar simon critchley contemporary anarchism can be seen as a powerful critique of the pseudolibertarianism of contemporary neoliberalism one might say that contemporary anarchism is about responsibility whether sexual ecological or socioeconomic it flows from an experience of conscience about the manifold ways in which the west ravages the rest it is an ethical outrage at the yawning inequality impoverishment and disenfranchisment that is so palpable locally and globally international anarchist federations in existence include the international of anarchist federations the international workers association and international libertarian solidarity the largest organised anarchist movement today is in spain in the form of the confederación general del trabajo cgt and the cnt cgt membership was estimated at around 100000 for 2003
0,portrait of philosopher pierrejoseph proudhon 18091865 by gustave courbet proudhon was the primary proponent of anarchist mutualism and influenced many later individualist anarchist and social anarchist thinkers anarchist schools of thought had been generally grouped in two main historical traditions individualist anarchism and social anarchism which have some different origins values and evolution the individualist wing of anarchism emphasises negative liberty ie opposition to state or social control over the individual while those in the social wing emphasise positive liberty to achieve ones potential and argue that humans have needs that society ought to fulfil recognising equality of entitlement in a chronological and theoretical sense there are classical those created throughout the 19th century and postclassical anarchist schools those created since the mid20th century and after beyond the specific factions of anarchist thought is philosophical anarchism which embodies the theoretical stance that the state lacks moral legitimacy without accepting the imperative of revolution to eliminate it a component especially of individualist anarchism philosophical anarchism may accept the existence of a minimal state as unfortunate and usually temporary necessary evil but argue that citizens do not have a moral obligation to obey the state when its laws conflict with individual autonomy one reaction against sectarianism within the anarchist milieu was anarchism without adjectives a call for toleration first adopted by fernando tarrida del mármol in 1889 in response to the bitter debates of anarchist theory at the time in abandoning the hyphenated anarchisms ie collectivist communist mutualist and individualistanarchism it sought to emphasise the antiauthoritarian beliefs common to all anarchist schools of thought classical anarchist schools of thought mutualism mutualism began in 18thcentury english and french labour movements before taking an anarchist form associated with pierrejoseph proudhon in france and others in the united states proudhon proposed spontaneous order whereby organisation emerges without central authority a positive anarchy where order arises when everybody does what he wishes and only what he wishes and where business transactions alone produce the social order proudhon distinguished between ideal political possibilities and practical governance for this reason much in contrast to some of his theoretical statements concerning ultimate spontaneous selfgovernance proudhon was heavily involved in french parliamentary politics and allied himself not with anarchist but socialist factions of workers movements and in addition to advocating stateprotected charters for workerowned cooperatives promoted certain nationalisation schemes during his life of public service mutualist anarchism is concerned with reciprocity free association voluntary contract federation and credit and currency reform according to the american mutualist william batchelder greene each worker in the mutualist system would receive just and exact pay for his work services equivalent in cost being exchangeable for services equivalent in cost without profit or discount mutualism has been retrospectively characterised as ideologically situated between individualist and collectivist forms of anarchismblackwell encyclopaedia of political thought blackwell publishing 1991 p 11 proudhon first characterised his goal as a third form of society the synthesis of communism and property individualist anarchism individualist anarchism refers to several traditions of thought within the anarchist movement that emphasise the individual and their will over any kinds of external determinants such as groups society traditions and ideological systems individualist anarchism is not a single philosophy but refers to a group of individualistic philosophies that sometimes are in conflict in 1793 william godwin who has often been cited as the first anarchist wrote political justice which some consider the first expression of anarchism godwin a philosophical anarchist from a rationalist and utilitarian basis opposed revolutionary action and saw a minimal state as a present necessary evil that would become increasingly irrelevant and powerless by the gradual spread of knowledge godwin advocated individualism proposing that all cooperation in labour be eliminated on the premise that this would be most conducive with the general good 19thcentury philosopher max stirner usually considered a prominent early individualist anarchist sketch by friedrich engels an influential form of individualist anarchism called egoism or egoist anarchism was expounded by one of the earliest and bestknown proponents of individualist anarchism the german max stirner stirners the ego and its own published in 1844 is a founding text of the philosophy according to stirner the only limitation on the rights of individuals is their power to obtain what they desire without regard for god state or morality to stirner rights were spooks in the mind and he held that society does not exist but the individuals are its reality stirner advocated selfassertion and foresaw unions of egoists nonsystematic associations continually renewed by all parties support through an act of will which stirner proposed as a form of organisation in place of the state egoist anarchists argue that egoism will foster genuine and spontaneous union between individuals egoism has inspired many interpretations of stirners philosophy it was rediscovered and promoted by german philosophical anarchist and homosexual activist john henry mackay josiah warren is widely regarded as the first american anarchist and the fourpage weekly paper he edited during 1833 the peaceful revolutionist was the first anarchist periodical published for american anarchist historian eunice minette schuster it is apparent that proudhonian anarchism was to be found in the united states at least as early as 1848 and that it was not conscious of its affinity to the individualist anarchism of josiah warren and stephen pearl andrews william b greene presented this proudhonian mutualism in its purest and most systematic form henry david thoreau 18171862 was an important early influence in individualist anarchist thought in the united states and europe thoreau was an american author poet naturalist tax resister development critic surveyor historian philosopher and leading transcendentalist he is best known for his books walden a reflection upon simple living in natural surroundings and his essay civil disobedience an argument for individual resistance to civil government in moral opposition to an unjust state later benjamin tucker fused stirners egoism with the economics of warren and proudhon in his eclectic influential publication liberty from these early influences individualist anarchism in different countries attracted a small but diverse following of bohemian artists and intellectuals free love and birth control advocates see anarchism and issues related to love and sex individualist naturists nudists see anarchonaturism freethought and anticlerical activists as well as young anarchist outlaws in what became known as illegalism and individual reclamation see european individualist anarchism and individualist anarchism in france these authors and activists included oscar wilde emile armand han ryner henri zisly renzo novatore miguel gimenez igualada adolf brand and lev chernyi among others social anarchism social anarchism calls for a system with common ownership of means of production and democratic control of all organisations without any government authority or coercion it is the largest school of thought in anarchism social anarchism rejects private property seeing it as a source of social inequality while retaining respect for personal property and emphasises cooperation and mutual aid collectivist anarchism collectivist anarchism also referred to as revolutionary socialism or a form of such is a revolutionary form of anarchism commonly associated with mikhail bakunin and johann most collectivist anarchists oppose all private ownership of the means of production instead advocating that ownership be collectivised this was to be achieved through violent revolution first starting with a small cohesive group through acts of violence or propaganda by the deed which would inspire the workers as a whole to revolt and forcibly collectivise the means of production however collectivisation was not to be extended to the distribution of income as workers would be paid according to time worked rather than receiving goods being distributed according to need as in anarchocommunism this position was criticised by anarchist communists as effectively upholding the wages system collectivist anarchism arose contemporaneously with marxism but opposed the marxist dictatorship of the proletariat despite the stated marxist goal of a collectivist stateless society anarchist communist and collectivist ideas are not mutually exclusive although the collectivist anarchists advocated compensation for labour some held out the possibility of a postrevolutionary transition to a communist system of distribution according to need anarchocommunism anarchist communism also known as anarchocommunism libertarian communism and occasionally as free communism is a theory of anarchism that advocates abolition of the state markets money private property while retaining respect for personal property and capitalism in favour of common ownership of the means of production direct democracy and a horizontal network of voluntary associations and workers councils with production and consumption based on the guiding principle from each according to his ability to each according to his need russian theorist peter kropotkin 18421921 who was influential in the development of anarchist communism some forms of anarchist communism such as insurrectionary anarchism are strongly influenced by egoism and radical individualism believing anarchocommunism is the best social system for the realisation of individual freedom most anarchocommunists view anarchocommunism as a way of reconciling the opposition between the individual and society anarchocommunism developed out of radical socialist currents after the french revolution but was first formulated as such in the italian section of the first international the theoretical work of peter kropotkin took importance later as it expanded and developed proorganisationalist and insurrectionary antiorganisationalist sections to date the best known examples of an anarchist communist society ie established around the ideas as they exist today and achieving worldwide attention and knowledge in the historical canon are the anarchist territories during the spanish revolution and the free territory during the russian revolution through the efforts and influence of the spanish anarchists during the spanish revolution within the spanish civil war starting in 1936 anarchist communism existed in most of aragon parts of the levante and andalusia as well as in the stronghold of anarchist catalonia before being crushed by the combined forces of the regime that won the war hitler mussolini spanish communist party repression backed by the ussr as well as economic and armaments blockades from the capitalist countries and the spanish republic itself during the russian revolution anarchists such as nestor makhno worked to create and defend through the revolutionary insurrectionary army of ukraine anarchist communism in the free territory of the ukraine from 1919 before being conquered by the bolsheviks in 1921 anarchosyndicalism may day demonstration of spanish anarchosyndicalist trade union cnt in bilbao basque country in 2010anarchosyndicalism is a branch of anarchism that focuses on the labour movement anarchosyndicalists view labour unions as a potential force for revolutionary social change replacing capitalism and the state with a new society democratically selfmanaged by workers the basic principles of anarchosyndicalism are workers solidarity direct action and workers selfmanagement anarchosyndicalists believe that only direct action that is action concentrated on directly attaining a goal as opposed to indirect action such as electing a representative to a government position will allow workers to liberate themselves moreover anarchosyndicalists believe that workers organisations the organisations that struggle against the wage system which in anarchosyndicalist theory will eventually form the basis of a new society should be selfmanaging they should not have bosses or business agents rather the workers should be able to make all the decisions that affect them themselves rudolf rocker was one of the most popular voices in the anarchosyndicalist movement he outlined a view of the origins of the movement what it sought and why it was important to the future of labour in his 1938 pamphlet anarchosyndicalism the international workers association is an international anarchosyndicalist federation of various labour unions from different countries the spanish confederación nacional del trabajo played and still plays a major role in the spanish labour movement it was also an important force in the spanish civil war postclassical schools of thought lawrence jarach left and john zerzan right two prominent contemporary anarchist authors zerzan is known as prominent voice within anarchoprimitivism while jarach is a noted advocate of postleft anarchy anarchism continues to generate many philosophies and movements at times eclectic drawing upon various sources and syncretic combining disparate concepts to create new philosophical approaches green anarchism or ecoanarchism is a school of thought within anarchism that emphasises environmental issues with an important precedent in anarchonaturism and whose main contemporary currents are anarchoprimitivism and social ecology writing from a green anarchist perspective john zerzan attributes the ills of todays social degradation to technology and the birth of agricultural civilization while layla abdelrahim argues that the shift in human consciousness was also a shift in human subsistence strategies whereby some human animals reinvented their narrative to center murder and predation and thereby institutionalize violence thus according to her civilization was the result of the human development of technologies and grammar for predatory economics language and literacy she claims are some of these technologies anarchafeminism also called anarchist feminism and anarchofeminism combines anarchism with feminism it generally views patriarchy as a manifestation of involuntary coercive hierarchy that should be replaced by decentralised free association anarchafeminists believe that the struggle against patriarchy is an essential part of class struggle and the anarchist struggle against the state in essence the philosophy sees anarchist struggle as a necessary component of feminist struggle and vice versa l susan brown claims that as anarchism is a political philosophy that opposes all relationships of power it is inherently feminist anarchafeminism began with the late 19thcentury writings of early feminist anarchists such as emma goldman and voltairine de cleyre anarchopacifism is a tendency that rejects violence in the struggle for social change see nonviolence it developed mostly in the netherlands britain and the united states before and during the second world war christian anarchism is a movement in political theology that combines anarchism and christianity its main proponents included leo tolstoy dorothy day ammon hennacy and jacques ellul platformism is a tendency within the wider anarchist movement based on the organisational theories in the tradition of dielo trudas organisational platform of the general union of anarchists draft the document was based on the experiences of russian anarchists in the 1917 october revolution which led eventually to the victory of the bolsheviks over the anarchists and other groups the platform attempted to address and explain the anarchist movements failures during the russian revolution synthesis anarchism is a form of anarchism that tries to join anarchists of different tendencies under the principles of anarchism without adjectives in the 1920s this form found as its main proponents the anarchocommunists voline and sébastien faure it is the main principle behind the anarchist federations grouped around the contemporary global international of anarchist federations postleft anarchy is a recent current in anarchist thought that promotes a critique of anarchisms relationship to traditional leftwing politics some postleftists seek to escape the confines of ideology in general also presenting a critique of organisations and morality influenced by the work of max stirner and by the marxist situationist international postleft anarchy is marked by a focus on social insurrection and a rejection of leftist social organisation insurrectionary anarchism is a revolutionary theory practice and tendency within the anarchist movement which emphasises insurrection within anarchist practice it is critical of formal organisations such as labour unions and federations that are based on a political programme and periodic congresses instead insurrectionary anarchists advocate informal organisation and small affinity group based organisation insurrectionary anarchists put value in attack permanent class conflict and a refusal to negotiate or compromise with class enemies postanarchism is a theoretical move towards a synthesis of classical anarchist theory and poststructuralist thought drawing from diverse ideas including postmodernism autonomist marxism postleft anarchy situationist international and postcolonialism leftwing market anarchism strongly affirm the classical liberal ideas of selfownership and free markets while maintaining that taken to their logical conclusions these ideas support strongly anticorporatist antihierarchical prolabour positions and anticapitalism in economics and antiimperialism in foreign policy anarchocapitalism advocates the elimination of the state in favour of selfownership in a free market anarchocapitalism developed from radical antistate libertarianism and individualist anarchism drawing from austrian school economics study of law and economics and public choice theory there is a strong current within anarchism which believes that anarchocapitalism cannot be considered a part of the anarchist movement due to the fact that anarchism has historically been an anticapitalist movement and for definitional reasons which see anarchism as incompatible with capitalist forms

0,anarchism is a political philosophy that advocates selfgoverned societies based on voluntary institutions these are often described as stateless societies although several authors have defined them more specifically as institutions based on nonhierarchical free associations anarchism holds the state to be undesirable unnecessary and harmful while antistatism is central anarchism specifically entails opposing authority or hierarchical organisation in the conduct of all human relations including but not limited to the state system anarchism is usually considered an extreme leftwing ideology and much of anarchist economics and anarchist legal philosophy reflects antiauthoritarian interpretations of communism collectivism syndicalism mutualism or participatory economics anarchism does not offer a fixed body of doctrine from a single particular world view instead fluxing and flowing as a philosophy many types and traditions of anarchism exist not all of which are mutually exclusive anarchist schools of thought can differ fundamentally supporting anything from extreme individualism to complete collectivism strains of anarchism have often been divided into the categories of social and individualist anarchism or similar dual classifications

1,a threeyearold with autism points to fish in an aquarium as part of an experiment on the effect of intensive sharedattention training on language development the main goals when treating children with autism are to lessen associated deficits and family distress and to increase quality of life and functional independence in general higher iqs are correlated with greater responsiveness to treatment and improved treatment outcomes no single treatment is best and treatment is typically tailored to the childs needs families and the educational system are the main resources for treatment studies of interventions have methodological problems that prevent definitive conclusions about efficacy however the development of evidencebased interventions has advanced in recent years although many psychosocial interventions have some positive evidence suggesting that some form of treatment is preferable to no treatment the methodological quality of systematic reviews of these studies has generally been poor their clinical results are mostly tentative and there is little evidence for the relative effectiveness of treatment options intensive sustained special education programs and behavior therapy early in life can help children acquire selfcare social and job skills and often improve functioning and decrease symptom severity and maladaptive behaviors claims that intervention by around age three years is crucial are not substantiated available approaches include applied behavior analysis aba developmental models structured teaching speech and language therapy social skills therapy and occupational therapy among these approaches interventions either treat autistic features comprehensively or focalize treatment on a specific area of deficit there is some evidence that early intensive behavioral intervention eibi an early intervention model based on aba for 20 to 40 hours a week for multiple years is an effective treatment for some children with asd two theoretical frameworks outlined for early childhood intervention include applied behavioral analysis aba and developmental social pragmatic models dsp one interventional strategy utilizes a parent training model which teaches parents how to implement various aba and dsp techniques allowing for parents to disseminate interventions themselves various dsp programs have been developed to explicitly deliver intervention systems through athome parent implementation despite the recent development of parent training models these interventions have demonstrated effectiveness in numerous studies being evaluated as a probable efficacious mode of treatment education educational interventions can be effective to varying degrees in most children intensive aba treatment has demonstrated effectiveness in enhancing global functioning in preschool children and is wellestablished for improving intellectual performance of young children similarly teacherimplemented intervention that utilizes an aba combined with a developmental social pragmatic approach has been found to be a wellestablished treatment in improving socialcommunication skills in young children although there is less evidence in its treatment of global symptoms neuropsychological reports are often poorly communicated to educators resulting in a gap between what a report recommends and what education is provided it is not known whether treatment programs for children lead to significant improvements after the children grow up and the limited research on the effectiveness of adult residential programs shows mixed results the appropriateness of including children with varying severity of autism spectrum disorders in the general education population is a subject of current debate among educators and researchers medication many medications are used to treat asd symptoms that interfere with integrating a child into home or school when behavioral treatment fails more than half of us children diagnosed with asd are prescribed psychoactive drugs or anticonvulsants with the most common drug classes being antidepressants stimulants and antipsychotics antipsychotics such as risperidone and aripiprazole have been found to be useful for treating irritability repetitive behavior and sleeplessness that often occurs with autism however their side effects must be weighed against their potential benefits and people with autism may respond atypically there is scant reliable research about the effectiveness or safety of drug treatments for adolescents and adults with asd no known medication relieves autisms core symptoms of social and communication impairments experiments in mice have reversed or reduced some symptoms related to autism by replacing or modulating gene function suggesting the possibility of targeting therapies to specific rare mutations known to cause autism alternative medicine although many alternative therapies and interventions are available few are supported by scientific studies treatment approaches have little empirical support in qualityoflife contexts and many programs focus on success measures that lack predictive validity and realworld relevance scientific evidence appears to matter less to service providers than program marketing training availability and parent requests some alternative treatments may place the child at risk a 2008 study found that compared to their peers autistic boys have significantly thinner bones if on caseinfree diets in 2005 botched chelation therapy killed a fiveyearold child with autism there has been early research looking at hyperbaric treatments in children with autism although popularly used as an alternative treatment for people with autism there is no good evidence that a glutenfree diet is of benefit in the subset of people who have gluten sensitivity there is limited evidence that suggests that a gluten free diet may improve some autistic behaviors cost treatment is expensive indirect costs are more so for someone born in 2000 a us study estimated an average lifetime cost of net present value in dollars inflationadjusted from 2003 estimate with about 10 medical care 30 extra education and other care and 60 lost economic productivity publicly supported programs are often inadequate or inappropriate for a given child and unreimbursed outofpocket medical or therapy expenses are associated with likelihood of family financial problems one 2008 us study found a 14 average loss of annual income in families of children with asd and a related study found that asd is associated with higher probability that child care problems will greatly affect parental employment us states increasingly require private health insurance to cover autism services shifting costs from publicly funded education programs to privately funded health insurance after childhood key treatment issues include residential care job training and placement sexuality social skills and estate planning
1,autism spectrum disorder video autism is a highly variable neurodevelopmental disorder that first appears during infancy or childhood and generally follows a steady course without remission people with autism may be severely impaired in some respects but normal or even superior in others overt symptoms gradually begin after the age of six months become established by age two or three years and tend to continue through adulthood although often in more muted form it is distinguished not by a single symptom but by a characteristic triad of symptoms impairments in social interaction impairments in communication and restricted interests and repetitive behavior other aspects such as atypical eating are also common but are not essential for diagnosis autisms individual symptoms occur in the general population and appear not to associate highly without a sharp line separating pathologically severe from common traits social development social deficits distinguish autism and the related autism spectrum disorders asd see classification from other developmental disorders people with autism have social impairments and often lack the intuition about others that many people take for granted noted autistic temple grandin described her inability to understand the social communication of neurotypicals or people with normal neural development as leaving her feeling like an anthropologist on mars unusual social development becomes apparent early in childhood autistic infants show less attention to social stimuli smile and look at others less often and respond less to their own name autistic toddlers differ more strikingly from social norms for example they have less eye contact and turntaking and do not have the ability to use simple movements to express themselves such as pointing at things three to fiveyearold children with autism are less likely to exhibit social understanding approach others spontaneously imitate and respond to emotions communicate nonverbally and take turns with others however they do form attachments to their primary caregivers most children with autism display moderately less attachment security than neurotypical children although this difference disappears in children with higher mental development or less severe asd older children and adults with asd perform worse on tests of face and emotion recognition although this may be partly due to a lower ability to define a persons own emotions children with highfunctioning autism suffer from more intense and frequent loneliness compared to nonautistic peers despite the common belief that children with autism prefer to be alone making and maintaining friendships often proves to be difficult for those with autism for them the quality of friendships not the number of friends predicts how lonely they feel functional friendships such as those resulting in invitations to parties may affect the quality of life more deeply there are many anecdotal reports but few systematic studies of aggression and violence in individuals with asd the limited data suggest that in children with intellectual disability autism is associated with aggression destruction of property and tantrums communication about a third to a half of individuals with autism do not develop enough natural speech to meet their daily communication needs differences in communication may be present from the first year of life and may include delayed onset of babbling unusual gestures diminished responsiveness and vocal patterns that are not synchronized with the caregiver in the second and third years children with autism have less frequent and less diverse babbling consonants words and word combinations their gestures are less often integrated with words children with autism are less likely to make requests or share experiences and are more likely to simply repeat others words echolalia or reverse pronouns joint attention seems to be necessary for functional speech and deficits in joint attention seem to distinguish infants with asd for example they may look at a pointing hand instead of the pointedat object and they consistently fail to point at objects in order to comment on or share an experience children with autism may have difficulty with imaginative play and with developing symbols into language in a pair of studies highfunctioning children with autism aged 815 performed equally well as and adults better than individually matched controls at basic language tasks involving vocabulary and spelling both autistic groups performed worse than controls at complex language tasks such as figurative language comprehension and inference as people are often sized up initially from their basic language skills these studies suggest that people speaking to autistic individuals are more likely to overestimate what their audience comprehends repetitive behavior a young boy with autism who has arranged his toys in a row autistic individuals can display many forms of repetitive or restricted behavior which the repetitive behavior scalerevised rbsr categorizes as follows stereotyped behaviors repetitive movements such as hand flapping head rolling or body rocking compulsive behaviors timeconsuming behaviors intended to reduce anxiety that an individual feels compelled to perform repeatedly or according to rigid rules such as placing objects in a specific order checking things or hand washing sameness resistance to change for example insisting that the furniture not be moved or refusing to be interrupted ritualistic behavior unvarying pattern of daily activities such as an unchanging menu or a dressing ritual this is closely associated with sameness and an independent validation has suggested combining the two factors restricted interests interests or fixations that are abnormal in theme or intensity of focus such as preoccupation with a single television program toy or game selfinjury behaviors such as eyepoking skinpicking handbiting and headbanging no single repetitive or selfinjurious behavior seems to be specific to autism but autism appears to have an elevated pattern of occurrence and severity of these behaviors other symptoms autistic individuals may have symptoms that are independent of the diagnosis but that can affect the individual or the family an estimated 05 to 10 of individuals with asd show unusual abilities ranging from splinter skills such as the memorization of trivia to the extraordinarily rare talents of prodigious autistic savants many individuals with asd show superior skills in perception and attention relative to the general population sensory abnormalities are found in over 90 of those with autism and are considered core features by some although there is no good evidence that sensory symptoms differentiate autism from other developmental disorders differences are greater for underresponsivity for example walking into things than for overresponsivity for example distress from loud noises or for sensation seeking for example rhythmic movements an estimated 6080 of autistic people have motor signs that include poor muscle tone poor motor planning and toe walking deficits in motor coordination are pervasive across asd and are greater in autism proper unusual eating behavior occurs in about threequarters of children with asd to the extent that it was formerly a diagnostic indicator selectivity is the most common problem although eating rituals and food refusal also occur this does not appear to result in malnutrition although some children with autism also have gastrointestinal symptoms there is a lack of published rigorous data to support the theory that children with autism have more or different gastrointestinal symptoms than usual studies report conflicting results and the relationship between gastrointestinal problems and asd is unclear parents of children with asd have higher levels of stress siblings of children with asd report greater admiration of and less conflict with the affected sibling than siblings of unaffected children and were similar to siblings of children with down syndrome in these aspects of the sibling relationship however they reported lower levels of closeness and intimacy than siblings of children with down syndrome siblings of individuals with asd have greater risk of negative wellbeing and poorer sibling relationships as adults
1,the emergence of the autism rights movement has served as an attempt to encourage people to be more tolerant of those with autism through this movement people hope to cause others to think of autism as a difference instead of a disease proponents of this movement wish to seek acceptance not cures there have also been many worldwide events promoting autism awareness such as world autism awareness day light it up blue autism sunday autistic pride day autreat and others there have also been many organizations dedicated to increasing the awareness of autism and the effects that autism has on someones life these organizations include autism speaks autism national committee autism society of america and many others socialscience scholars have had an increased focused on studying those with autism in hopes to learn more about autism as a culture transcultural comparisons and research on social movements media has had an influence on how the public perceives those with autism rain man a film that won 4 oscars including best picture depicts a character with autism who has incredible talents and abilities while many autistics dont have these special abilities there are some autistic individuals who have been successful in their fields

1,autisms symptoms result from maturationrelated changes in various systems of the brain how autism occurs is not well understood its mechanism can be divided into two areas the pathophysiology of brain structures and processes associated with autism and the neuropsychological linkages between brain structures and behaviors the behaviors appear to have multiple pathophysiologies pathophysiology autism affects the amygdala cerebellum and many other parts of the brain unlike many other brain disorders such as parkinsons autism does not have a clear unifying mechanism at either the molecular cellular or systems level it is not known whether autism is a few disorders caused by mutations converging on a few common molecular pathways or is like intellectual disability a large set of disorders with diverse mechanisms autism appears to result from developmental factors that affect many or all functional brain systems and to disturb the timing of brain development more than the final product neuroanatomical studies and the associations with teratogens strongly suggest that autisms mechanism includes alteration of brain development soon after conception this anomaly appears to start a cascade of pathological events in the brain that are significantly influenced by environmental factors just after birth the brains of children with autism tend to grow faster than usual followed by normal or relatively slower growth in childhood it is not known whether early overgrowth occurs in all children with autism it seems to be most prominent in brain areas underlying the development of higher cognitive specialization hypotheses for the cellular and molecular bases of pathological early overgrowth include the following an excess of neurons that causes local overconnectivity in key brain regions disturbed neuronal migration during early gestation unbalanced excitatoryinhibitory networks abnormal formation of synapses and dendritic spines for example by modulation of the neurexinneuroligin celladhesion system or by poorly regulated synthesis of synaptic proteins disrupted synaptic development may also contribute to epilepsy which may explain why the two conditions are associated the immune system is thought to play an important role in autism children with autism have been found by researchers to have inflammation of both the peripheral and central immune systems as indicated by increased levels of proinflammatory cytokines and significant activation of microglia biomarkers of abnormal immune function have also been associated with increased impairments in behaviors that are characteristic of the core features of autism such as deficits in social interactions and communication interactions between the immune system and the nervous system begin early during the embryonic stage of life and successful neurodevelopment depends on a balanced immune response it is thought that activation of a pregnant mothers immune system such as from environmental toxicants or infection can contribute to causing autism through causing a disruption of brain development this is supported by recent studies that have found that infection during pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of autism the relationship of neurochemicals to autism is not well understood several have been investigated with the most evidence for the role of serotonin and of genetic differences in its transport the role of group i metabotropic glutamate receptors mglur in the pathogenesis of fragile x syndrome the most common identified genetic cause of autism has led to interest in the possible implications for future autism research into this pathway some data suggests neuronal overgrowth potentially related to an increase in several growth hormones or to impaired regulation of growth factor receptors also some inborn errors of metabolism are associated with autism but probably account for less than 5 of cases the mirror neuron system mns theory of autism hypothesizes that distortion in the development of the mns interferes with imitation and leads to autisms core features of social impairment and communication difficulties the mns operates when an animal performs an action or observes another animal perform the same action the mns may contribute to an individuals understanding of other people by enabling the modeling of their behavior via embodied simulation of their actions intentions and emotions several studies have tested this hypothesis by demonstrating structural abnormalities in mns regions of individuals with asd delay in the activation in the core circuit for imitation in individuals with asperger syndrome and a correlation between reduced mns activity and severity of the syndrome in children with asd however individuals with autism also have abnormal brain activation in many circuits outside the mns and the mns theory does not explain the normal performance of children with autism on imitation tasks that involve a goal or object autistic individuals tend to use different areas of the brain yellow for a movement task compared to a control group blue asdrelated patterns of low function and aberrant activation in the brain differ depending on whether the brain is doing social or nonsocial tasks in autism there is evidence for reduced functional connectivity of the default network a largescale brain network involved in social and emotional processing with intact connectivity of the taskpositive network used in sustained attention and goaldirected thinking in people with autism the two networks are not negatively correlated in time suggesting an imbalance in toggling between the two networks possibly reflecting a disturbance of selfreferential thought the underconnectivity theory of autism hypothesizes that autism is marked by underfunctioning highlevel neural connections and synchronization along with an excess of lowlevel processes evidence for this theory has been found in functional neuroimaging studies on autistic individuals and by a brainwave study that suggested that adults with asd have local overconnectivity in the cortex and weak functional connections between the frontal lobe and the rest of the cortex other evidence suggests the underconnectivity is mainly within each hemisphere of the cortex and that autism is a disorder of the association cortex from studies based on eventrelated potentials transient changes to the brains electrical activity in response to stimuli there is considerable evidence for differences in autistic individuals with respect to attention orientation to auditory and visual stimuli novelty detection language and face processing and information storage several studies have found a preference for nonsocial stimuli for example magnetoencephalography studies have found evidence in children with autism of delayed responses in the brains processing of auditory signals in the genetic area relations have been found between autism and schizophrenia based on duplications and deletions of chromosomes research showed that schizophrenia and autism are significantly more common in combination with 1q211 deletion syndrome research on autismschizophrenia relations for chromosome 15 15q133 chromosome 16 16p131 and chromosome 17 17p12 are inconclusive functional connectivity studies have found both hypo and hyperconnectivity in brains of people with autism hypoconnectivity seems to dominate especially for interhemispheric and corticocortical functional connectivity neuropsychology two major categories of cognitive theories have been proposed about the links between autistic brains and behavior the first category focuses on deficits in social cognition simon baroncohens empathizingsystemizing theory postulates that autistic individuals can systemizethat is they can develop internal rules of operation to handle events inside the brainbut are less effective at empathizing by handling events generated by other agents an extension the extreme male brain theory hypothesizes that autism is an extreme case of the male brain defined psychometrically as individuals in whom systemizing is better than empathizing these theories are somewhat related to baroncohens earlier theory of mind approach which hypothesizes that autistic behavior arises from an inability to ascribe mental states to oneself and others the theory of mind hypothesis is supported by the atypical responses of children with autism to the sallyanne test for reasoning about others motivations and the mirror neuron system theory of autism described in pathophysiology maps well to the hypothesis however most studies have found no evidence of impairment in autistic individuals ability to understand other peoples basic intentions or goals instead data suggests that impairments are found in understanding more complex social emotions or in considering others viewpoints the second category focuses on nonsocial or general processing the executive functions such as working memory planning inhibition in his review kenworthy states that the claim of executive dysfunction as a causal factor in autism is controversial however it is clear that executive dysfunction plays a role in the social and cognitive deficits observed in individuals with autism tests of core executive processes such as eye movement tasks indicate improvement from late childhood to adolescence but performance never reaches typical adult levels a strength of the theory is predicting stereotyped behavior and narrow interests two weaknesses are that executive function is hard to measure and that executive function deficits have not been found in young children with autism weak central coherence theory hypothesizes that a limited ability to see the big picture underlies the central disturbance in autism one strength of this theory is predicting special talents and peaks in performance in autistic people a related theoryenhanced perceptual functioningfocuses more on the superiority of locally oriented and perceptual operations in autistic individuals these theories map well from the underconnectivity theory of autism neither category is satisfactory on its own social cognition theories poorly address autisms rigid and repetitive behaviors while the nonsocial theories have difficulty explaining social impairment and communication difficulties a combined theory based on multiple deficits may prove to be more useful
1,autism is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by impaired social interaction impaired verbal and nonverbal communication and restricted and repetitive behavior parents usually notice signs in the first two years of their childs life these signs often develop gradually though some children with autism reach their developmental milestones at a normal pace and then regress the diagnostic criteria require that symptoms become apparent in early childhood typically before age three autism is caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors some cases are strongly associated with certain infections during pregnancy including rubella and use of alcohol or cocaine controversies surround other proposed environmental causes for example the vaccine hypotheses which have since been disproven autism affects information processing in the brain by altering how nerve cells and their synapses connect and organize how this occurs is not well understood in the dsm v autism is included within the autism spectrum asds as is asperger syndrome which lacks delays in cognitive development and language and pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified commonly abbreviated as pddnos which was diagnosed when the full set of criteria for autism or asperger syndrome were not met early speech or behavioral interventions can help children with autism gain selfcare social and communication skills although there is no known cure there have been reported cases of children who recovered not many children with autism live independently after reaching adulthood though some become successful an autistic culture has developed with some individuals seeking a cure and others believing autism should be accepted as a difference and not treated as a disorder globally autism is estimated to affect 248 million people as of 2015 as of 2010 the number of people affected is estimated at about 12 per 1000 worldwide it occurs four to five times more often in boys than girls about 15 of children in the united states one in 68 are diagnosed with asd a 30 increase from one in 88 in 2012 the rate of autism among adults aged 18 years and over in the united kingdom is 11 the number of people diagnosed has been increasing dramatically since the 1980s partly due to changes in diagnostic practice the question of whether actual rates have increased is unresolved
1,it has long been presumed that there is a common cause at the genetic cognitive and neural levels for autisms characteristic triad of symptoms however there is increasing suspicion that autism is instead a complex disorder whose core aspects have distinct causes that often cooccur deletion 1 duplication 2 and inversion 3 are all chromosome abnormalities that have been implicated in autism autism has a strong genetic basis although the genetics of autism are complex and it is unclear whether asd is explained more by rare mutations with major effects or by rare multigene interactions of common genetic variants complexity arises due to interactions among multiple genes the environment and epigenetic factors which do not change dna sequencing but are heritable and influence gene expression many genes have been associated with autism through sequencing the genomes of affected individuals and their parents studies of twins suggest that heritability is 07 for autism and as high as 09 for asd and siblings of those with autism are about 25 times more likely to be autistic than the general population however most of the mutations that increase autism risk have not been identified typically autism cannot be traced to a mendelian singlegene mutation or to a single chromosome abnormality and none of the genetic syndromes associated with asds have been shown to selectively cause asd numerous candidate genes have been located with only small effects attributable to any particular gene most loci individually explain less than 1 of cases of autism the large number of autistic individuals with unaffected family members may result from spontaneous structural variation such as deletions duplications or inversions in genetic material during meiosis hence a substantial fraction of autism cases may be traceable to genetic causes that are highly heritable but not inherited that is the mutation that causes the autism is not present in the parental genome several lines of evidence point to synaptic dysfunction as a cause of autism some rare mutations may lead to autism by disrupting some synaptic pathways such as those involved with cell adhesion gene replacement studies in mice suggest that autistic symptoms are closely related to later developmental steps that depend on activity in synapses and on activitydependent changes all known teratogens agents that cause birth defects related to the risk of autism appear to act during the first eight weeks from conception and though this does not exclude the possibility that autism can be initiated or affected later there is strong evidence that autism arises very early in development exposure to air pollution during pregnancy especially heavy metals and particulates may increase the risk of autism environmental factors that have been claimed without evidence to contribute to or exacerbate autism include certain foods infectious diseases solvents diesel exhaust pcbs phthalates and phenols used in plastic products pesticides brominated flame retardants alcohol smoking illicit drugs vaccines and prenatal stress no evidence has been found for these claims and some such as the mmr vaccine have been completely disproven parents may first become aware of autistic symptoms in their child around the time of a routine vaccination this has led to unsupported theories blaming vaccine overload a vaccine preservative or the mmr vaccine for causing autism the latter theory was supported by a litigationfunded study that has since been shown to have been an elaborate fraud although these theories lack convincing scientific evidence and are biologically implausible parental concern about a potential vaccine link with autism has led to lower rates of childhood immunizations outbreaks of previously controlled childhood diseases in some countries and the preventable deaths of several children
1,diagnosis is based on behavior not cause or mechanism under the dsm5 autism is characterized by persistent deficits in social communication and interaction across multiple contexts as well as restricted repetitive patterns of behavior interests or activities these deficits are present in early childhood typically before age three and lead to clinically significant functional impairment sample symptoms include lack of social or emotional reciprocity stereotyped and repetitive use of language or idiosyncratic language and persistent preoccupation with unusual objects the disturbance must not be better accounted for by rett syndrome intellectual disability or global developmental delay icd10 uses essentially the same definition several diagnostic instruments are available two are commonly used in autism research the autism diagnostic interviewrevised adir is a semistructured parent interview and the autism diagnostic observation schedule ados uses observation and interaction with the child the childhood autism rating scale cars is used widely in clinical environments to assess severity of autism based on observation of children the diagnostic interview for social and communication disorders disco may also be used a pediatrician commonly performs a preliminary investigation by taking developmental history and physically examining the child if warranted diagnosis and evaluations are conducted with help from asd specialists observing and assessing cognitive communication family and other factors using standardized tools and taking into account any associated medical conditions a pediatric neuropsychologist is often asked to assess behavior and cognitive skills both to aid diagnosis and to help recommend educational interventions a differential diagnosis for asd at this stage might also consider intellectual disability hearing impairment and a specific language impairment such as landaukleffner syndrome the presence of autism can make it harder to diagnose coexisting psychiatric disorders such as depression clinical genetics evaluations are often done once asd is diagnosed particularly when other symptoms already suggest a genetic cause although genetic technology allows clinical geneticists to link an estimated 40 of cases to genetic causes consensus guidelines in the us and uk are limited to highresolution chromosome and fragile x testing a genotypefirst model of diagnosis has been proposed which would routinely assess the genomes copy number variations as new genetic tests are developed several ethical legal and social issues will emerge commercial availability of tests may precede adequate understanding of how to use test results given the complexity of autisms genetics metabolic and neuroimaging tests are sometimes helpful but are not routine asd can sometimes be diagnosed by age 14 months although diagnosis becomes increasingly stable over the first three years of life for example a oneyearold who meets diagnostic criteria for asd is less likely than a threeyearold to continue to do so a few years later in the uk the national autism plan for children recommends at most 30 weeks from first concern to completed diagnosis and assessment though few cases are handled that quickly in practice although the symptoms of autism and asd begin early in childhood they are sometimes missed years later adults may seek diagnoses to help them or their friends and family understand themselves to help their employers make adjustments or in some locations to claim disability living allowances or other benefits underdiagnosis and overdiagnosis are problems in marginal cases and much of the recent increase in the number of reported asd cases is likely due to changes in diagnostic practices the increasing popularity of drug treatment options and the expansion of benefits has given providers incentives to diagnose asd resulting in some overdiagnosis of children with uncertain symptoms conversely the cost of screening and diagnosis and the challenge of obtaining payment can inhibit or delay diagnosis it is particularly hard to diagnose autism among the visually impaired partly because some of its diagnostic criteria depend on vision and partly because autistic symptoms overlap with those of common blindness syndromes or blindisms classification autism is one of the five pervasive developmental disorders pdd which are characterized by widespread abnormalities of social interactions and communication and severely restricted interests and highly repetitive behavior these symptoms do not imply sickness fragility or emotional disturbance of the five pdd forms asperger syndrome is closest to autism in signs and likely causes rett syndrome and childhood disintegrative disorder share several signs with autism but may have unrelated causes pdd not otherwise specified pddnos also called atypical autism is diagnosed when the criteria are not met for a more specific disorder unlike with autism people with asperger syndrome have no substantial delay in language development the terminology of autism can be bewildering with autism asperger syndrome and pddnos often called the autism spectrum disorders asd or sometimes the autistic disorders whereas autism itself is often called autistic disorder childhood autism or infantile autism in this article autism refers to the classic autistic disorder in clinical practice though autism asd and pdd are often used interchangeably asd in turn is a subset of the broader autism phenotype which describes individuals who may not have asd but do have autisticlike traits such as avoiding eye contact the manifestations of autism cover a wide spectrum ranging from individuals with severe impairmentswho may be silent developmentally disabled and locked into hand flapping and rockingto high functioning individuals who may have active but distinctly odd social approaches narrowly focused interests and verbose pedantic communication because the behavior spectrum is continuous boundaries between diagnostic categories are necessarily somewhat arbitrary sometimes the syndrome is divided into low medium or highfunctioning autism lfa mfa and hfa based on iq thresholds or on how much support the individual requires in daily life these subdivisions are not standardized and are controversial autism can also be divided into syndromal and nonsyndromal autism the syndromal autism is associated with severe or profound intellectual disability or a congenital syndrome with physical symptoms such as tuberous sclerosis although individuals with asperger syndrome tend to perform better cognitively than those with autism the extent of the overlap between asperger syndrome hfa and nonsyndromal autism is unclear some studies have reported diagnoses of autism in children due to a loss of language or social skills as opposed to a failure to make progress typically from 15 to 30 months of age the validity of this distinction remains controversial it is possible that regressive autism is a specific subtype or that there is a continuum of behaviors between autism with and without regression research into causes has been hampered by the inability to identify biologically meaningful subgroups within the autistic population and by the traditional boundaries between the disciplines of psychiatry psychology neurology and pediatrics newer technologies such as fmri and diffusion tensor imaging can help identify biologically relevant phenotypes observable traits that can be viewed on brain scans to help further neurogenetic studies of autism one example is lowered activity in the fusiform face area of the brain which is associated with impaired perception of people versus objects it has been proposed to classify autism using genetics as well as behavior
1,reports of autism cases per 1000 children grew dramatically in the us from 1996 to 2007 it is unknown how much if any growth came from changes in rates of autism most recent reviews tend to estimate a prevalence of 12 per 1000 for autism and close to 6 per 1000 for asd and 11 per 1000 children in the united states for asd as of 2008 because of inadequate data these numbers may underestimate asds true rate globally autism affects an estimated 248 million people as of 2015 while asperger syndrome affects a further 372 million in 2012 the nhs estimated that the overall prevalence of autism among adults aged 18 years and over in the uk was 11 rates of pddnoss has been estimated at 37 per 1000 asperger syndrome at roughly 06 per 1000 and childhood disintegrative disorder at 002 per 1000 cdcs most recent estimate is that 1 out of every 68 children or 147 per 1000 has an asd as of 2010 the number of reported cases of autism increased dramatically in the 1990s and early 2000s this increase is largely attributable to changes in diagnostic practices referral patterns availability of services age at diagnosis and public awareness though unidentified environmental risk factors cannot be ruled out the available evidence does not rule out the possibility that autisms true prevalence has increased a real increase would suggest directing more attention and funding toward changing environmental factors instead of continuing to focus on genetics boys are at higher risk for asd than girls the sex ratio averages 431 and is greatly modified by cognitive impairment it may be close to 21 with intellectual disability and more than 551 without several theories about the higher prevalence in males have been investigated but the cause of the difference is unconfirmed one theory is that females are underdiagnosed although the evidence does not implicate any single pregnancyrelated risk factor as a cause of autism the risk of autism is associated with advanced age in either parent and with diabetes bleeding and use of psychiatric drugs in the mother during pregnancy the risk is greater with older fathers than with older mothers two potential explanations are the known increase in mutation burden in older sperm and the hypothesis that men marry later if they carry genetic liability and show some signs of autism most professionals believe that race ethnicity and socioeconomic background do not affect the occurrence of autism several other conditions are common in children with autism they include genetic disorders about 1015 of autism cases have an identifiable mendelian singlegene condition chromosome abnormality or other genetic syndrome and asd is associated with several genetic disorders intellectual disability the percentage of autistic individuals who also meet criteria for intellectual disability has been reported as anywhere from 25 to 70 a wide variation illustrating the difficulty of assessing autistic intelligence in comparison for pddnos the association with intellectual disability is much weaker and by definition the diagnosis of aspergers excludes intellectual disability anxiety disorders are common among children with asd there are no firm data but studies have reported prevalences ranging from 11 to 84 many anxiety disorders have symptoms that are better explained by asd itself or are hard to distinguish from asds symptoms epilepsy with variations in risk of epilepsy due to age cognitive level and type of language disorder several metabolic defects such as phenylketonuria are associated with autistic symptoms minor physical anomalies are significantly increased in the autistic population preempted diagnoses although the dsmiv rules out concurrent diagnosis of many other conditions along with autism the full criteria for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder adhd tourette syndrome and other of these conditions are often present and these comorbid diagnoses are increasingly accepted sleep problems affect about twothirds of individuals with asd at some point in childhood these most commonly include symptoms of insomnia such as difficulty in falling asleep frequent nocturnal awakenings and early morning awakenings sleep problems are associated with difficult behaviors and family stress and are often a focus of clinical attention over and above the primary asd diagnosis
1,leo kanner introduced the label early infantile autism in 1943 a few examples of autistic symptoms and treatments were described long before autism was named the table talk of martin luther compiled by his notetaker mathesius contains the story of a 12yearold boy who may have been severely autistic luther reportedly thought the boy was a soulless mass of flesh possessed by the devil and suggested that he be suffocated although a later critic has cast doubt on the veracity of this report the earliest welldocumented case of autism is that of hugh blair of borgue as detailed in a 1747 court case in which his brother successfully petitioned to annul blairs marriage to gain blairs inheritance the wild boy of aveyron a feral child caught in 1798 showed several signs of autism the medical student jean itard treated him with a behavioral program designed to help him form social attachments and to induce speech via imitation the new latin word autismus english translation autism was coined by the swiss psychiatrist eugen bleuler in 1910 as he was defining symptoms of schizophrenia he derived it from the greek word autós αὐτός meaning self and used it to mean morbid selfadmiration referring to autistic withdrawal of the patient to his fantasies against which any influence from outside becomes an intolerable disturbance the word autism first took its modern sense in 1938 when hans asperger of the vienna university hospital adopted bleulers terminology autistic psychopaths in a lecture in german about child psychology asperger was investigating an asd now known as asperger syndrome though for various reasons it was not widely recognized as a separate diagnosis until 1981 leo kanner of the johns hopkins hospital first used autism in its modern sense in english when he introduced the label early infantile autism in a 1943 report of 11 children with striking behavioral similarities almost all the characteristics described in kanners first paper on the subject notably autistic aloneness and insistence on sameness are still regarded as typical of the autistic spectrum of disorders it is not known whether kanner derived the term independently of asperger donald triplett was the first person diagnosed with autism he was diagnosed by leo kanner after being first examined in 1938 and was labeled as case 1 triplett was noted for his savant abilities particularly being able to name musical notes played on a piano and to mentally multiply numbers his father oliver described him as socially withdrawn but interested in number patterns music notes letters of the alphabet and us president pictures by the age of 2 he had the ability to recite the 23rd psalm and memorized 25 questions and answers from the presbyterian catechism he was also interested in creating musical chords kanners reuse of autism led to decades of confused terminology like infantile schizophrenia and child psychiatrys focus on maternal deprivation led to misconceptions of autism as an infants response to refrigerator mothers starting in the late 1960s autism was established as a separate syndrome as late as the mid1970s there was little evidence of a genetic role in autism while in 2007 it was believed to be one of the most heritable psychiatric conditions although the rise of parent organizations and the destigmatization of childhood asd have affected how asd is viewed parents continue to feel social stigma in situations where their childs autistic behavior is perceived negatively and many primary care physicians and medical specialists express some beliefs consistent with outdated autism research it took until 1980 for the dsmiii to differentiate autism from childhood schizophrenia in 1987 the dsmiiir provided a checklist for diagnosing autism in may 2013 the dsm5 was released updating the classification for pervasive developmental disorders the grouping of disorders including pddnos autism asperger syndrome rett syndrome and cdd has been removed and replaced with the general term of autism spectrum disorders the two categories that exist are impaired social communication andor interaction and restricted andor repetitive behaviors the internet has helped autistic individuals bypass nonverbal cues and emotional sharing that they find so hard to deal with and has given them a way to form online communities and work remotely sociological and cultural aspects of autism have developed some in the community seek a cure while others believe that autism is simply another way of being
1,there is no known cure children recover occasionally so that they lose their diagnosis of asd this occurs sometimes after intensive treatment and sometimes not it is not known how often recovery happens reported rates in unselected samples of children with asd have ranged from 3 to 25 most children with autism acquire language by age five or younger though a few have developed communication skills in later years most children with autism lack social support meaningful relationships future employment opportunities or selfdetermination although core difficulties tend to persist symptoms often become less severe with age few highquality studies address longterm prognosis some adults show modest improvement in communication skills but a few decline no study has focused on autism after midlife acquiring language before age six having an iq above 50 and having a marketable skill all predict better outcomes independent living is unlikely with severe autism most people with autism face significant obstacles in transitioning to adulthood

2,percentage of diffusely reflected sunlight in relation to various surface conditions albedo is a measure for reflectance or optical brightness latin albedo whiteness of a surface it is dimensionless and measured on a scale from zero corresponding to a black body that absorbs all incident radiation to one corresponding to a white body that reflects all incident radiation surface albedo is defined as the ratio of irradiance reflected to the irradiance received by a surface the proportion reflected is not only determined by properties of the surface itself but also by the spectral and angular distribution of solar radiation reaching the earths surface these factors vary with atmospheric composition geographic location and time see position of the sun while bihemispherical reflectance is calculated for a single angle of incidence ie for a given position of the sun albedo is the directional integration of reflectance over all solar angles in a given period the temporal resolution may range from seconds as obtained from flux measurements to daily monthly or annual averages unless given for a specific wavelength spectral albedo albedo refers to the entire spectrum of solar radiation due to measurement constraints it is often given for the spectrum in which most solar energy reaches the surface approximately between 03 and 3 μm this spectrum includes visible light 03907 μm which explains why surfaces with a low albedo appear dark eg trees absorb most radiation whereas surfaces with a high albedo appear bright eg snow reflects most radiation albedo is an important concept in climatology astronomy and environmental management eg as part of the leadership in energy and environmental design leed program for sustainable rating of buildings the average albedo of the earth at the top of the atmosphere its planetary albedo is 30 to 35 because of cloud cover but widely varies locally across the surface because of different geological and environmental features the term albedo was introduced into optics by johann heinrich lambert in his 1760 work photometria

2,the albedos of planets satellites and minor planets such as asteroids can be used to infer much about their properties the study of albedos their dependence on wavelength lighting angle phase angle and variation in time comprises a major part of the astronomical field of photometry for small and far objects that cannot be resolved by telescopes much of what we know comes from the study of their albedos for example the absolute albedo can indicate the surface ice content of outer solar system objects the variation of albedo with phase angle gives information about regolith properties whereas unusually high radar albedo is indicative of high metal content in asteroids enceladus a moon of saturn has one of the highest known albedos of any body in the solar system with 99 of em radiation reflected another notable highalbedo body is eris with an albedo of 096 many small objects in the outer solar system and asteroid belt have low albedos down to about 005 a typical comet nucleus has an albedo of 004 such a dark surface is thought to be indicative of a primitive and heavily space weathered surface containing some organic compounds the overall albedo of the moon is measured to be around 0136 but it is strongly directional and nonlambertian displaying also a strong opposition effect although such reflectance properties are different from those of any terrestrial terrains they are typical of the regolith surfaces of airless solar system bodies two common albedos that are used in astronomy are the vband geometric albedo measuring brightness when illumination comes from directly behind the observer and the bond albedo measuring total proportion of electromagnetic energy reflected their values can differ significantly which is a common source of confusion in detailed studies the directional reflectance properties of astronomical bodies are often expressed in terms of the five hapke parameters which semiempirically describe the variation of albedo with phase angle including a characterization of the opposition effect of regolith surfaces the correlation between astronomical geometric albedo absolute magnitude and diameter is where is the astronomical albedo is the diameter in kilometers and is the absolute magnitude

2,illumination although the albedotemperature effect is best known in colder whiter regions on earth the maximum albedo is actually found in the tropics where yearround illumination is greater the maximum is additionally in the northern hemisphere varying between three and twelve degrees north the minima are found in the subtropical regions of the northern and southern hemispheres beyond which albedo increases without respect to illumination insolation effects the intensity of albedo temperature effects depend on the amount of albedo and the level of local insolation solar irradiance high albedo areas in the arctic and antarctic regions are cold due to low insolation where areas such as the sahara desert which also have a relatively high albedo will be hotter due to high insolation tropical and subtropical rainforest areas have low albedo and are much hotter than their temperate forest counterparts which have lower insolation because insolation plays such a big role in the heating and cooling effects of albedo high insolation areas like the tropics will tend to show a more pronounced fluctuation in local temperature when local albedo changes arctic regions notably release more heat back into space than what they absorb effectively cooling the earth this has been a concern since arctic ice and snow has been melting at higher rates due to higher temperatures creating regions in the arctic that are notably darker being water or ground which is darker color and reflects less heat back into space this feedback loop results in a reduced albedo effect climate and weather albedo affects climate by determining how much radiation a planet absorbs the uneven heating of earth from albedo variations between land ice or ocean surfaces can drive weather albedotemperature feedback when an areas albedo changes due to snowfall a snowtemperature feedback results a layer of snowfall increases local albedo reflecting away sunlight leading to local cooling in principle if no outside temperature change affects this area eg a warm air mass the raised albedo and lower temperature would maintain the current snow and invite further snowfall deepening the snowtemperature feedback however because local weather is dynamic due to the change of seasons eventually warm air masses and a more direct angle of sunlight higher insolation cause melting when the melted area reveals surfaces with lower albedo such as grass or soil the effect is reversed the darkening surface lowers albedo increasing local temperatures which induces more melting and thus reducing the albedo further resulting in still more heating snow snow albedo is highly variable ranging from as high as 09 for freshly fallen snow to about 04 for melting snow and as low as 02 for dirty snow over antarctica they average a little more than 08 if a marginally snowcovered area warms snow tends to melt lowering the albedo and hence leading to more snowmelt because more radiation is being absorbed by the snowpack the icealbedo positive feedback cryoconite powdery windblown dust containing soot sometimes reduces albedo on glaciers and ice sheets hence small errors in albedo can lead to large errors in energy estimates which is why it is important to measure the albedo of snowcovered areas through remote sensing techniques rather than applying a single value over broad regions smallscale effects albedo works on a smaller scale too in sunlight dark clothes absorb more heat and lightcoloured clothes reflect it better thus allowing some control over body temperature by exploiting the albedo effect of the colour of external clothing solar photovoltaic effects albedo can affect the electrical energy output of solar photovoltaic devices for example the effects of a spectrally responsive albedo are illustrated by the differences between the spectrally weighted albedo of solar photovoltaic technology based on hydrogenated amorphous silicon asih and crystalline silicon csibased compared to traditional spectralintegrated albedo predictions research showed impacts of over 10 more recently the analysis was extended to the effects of spectral bias due to the specular reflectivity of 22 commonly occurring surface materials both humanmade and natural and analyzes the albedo effects on the performance of seven photovoltaic materials covering three common photovoltaic system topologies industrial solar farms commercial flat rooftops and residential pitchedroof applications trees because forests generally have a low albedo the majority of the ultraviolet and visible spectrum is absorbed through photosynthesis some scientists have suggested that greater heat absorption by trees could offset some of the carbon benefits of afforestation or offset the negative climate impacts of deforestation in the case of evergreen forests with seasonal snow cover albedo reduction may be great enough for deforestation to cause a net cooling effect trees also impact climate in extremely complicated ways through evapotranspiration the water vapor causes cooling on the land surface causes heating where it condenses acts a strong greenhouse gas and can increase albedo when it condenses into clouds scientists generally treat evapotranspiration as a net cooling impact and the net climate impact of albedo and evapotranspiration changes from deforestation depends greatly on local climate in seasonally snowcovered zones winter albedos of treeless areas are 10 to 50 higher than nearby forested areas because snow does not cover the trees as readily deciduous trees have an albedo value of about 015 to 018 whereas coniferous trees have a value of about 009 to 015 studies by the hadley centre have investigated the relative generally warming effect of albedo change and cooling effect of carbon sequestration on planting forests they found that new forests in tropical and midlatitude areas tended to cool new forests in high latitudes eg siberia were neutral or perhaps warming water water reflects light very differently from typical terrestrial materials the reflectivity of a water surface is calculated using the fresnel equations see graph reflectivity of smooth water at 20 c refractive index1333 at the scale of the wavelength of light even wavy water is always smooth so the light is reflected in a locally specular manner not diffusely the glint of light off water is a commonplace effect of this at small angles of incident light waviness results in reduced reflectivity because of the steepness of the reflectivityvsincidentangle curve and a locally increased average incident angle although the reflectivity of water is very low at low and medium angles of incident light it becomes very high at high angles of incident light such as those that occur on the illuminated side of earth near the terminator early morning late afternoon and near the poles however as mentioned above waviness causes an appreciable reduction because light specularly reflected from water does not usually reach the viewer water is usually considered to have a very low albedo in spite of its high reflectivity at high angles of incident light note that white caps on waves look white and have high albedo because the water is foamed up so there are many superimposed bubble surfaces which reflect adding up their reflectivities fresh black ice exhibits fresnel reflection clouds cloud albedo has substantial influence over atmospheric temperatures different types of clouds exhibit different reflectivity theoretically ranging in albedo from a minimum of near 0 to a maximum approaching 08 on any given day about half of earth is covered by clouds which reflect more sunlight than land and water clouds keep earth cool by reflecting sunlight but they can also serve as blankets to trap warmth albedo and climate in some areas are affected by artificial clouds such as those created by the contrails of heavy commercial airliner traffic a study following the burning of the kuwaiti oil fields during iraqi occupation showed that temperatures under the burning oil fires were as much as 10 c colder than temperatures several miles away under clear skies aerosol effects aerosols very fine particlesdroplets in the atmosphere have both direct and indirect effects on earths radiative balance the direct albedo effect is generally to cool the planet the indirect effect the particles act as cloud condensation nuclei and thereby change cloud properties is less certain as per the effects are aerosol direct effect aerosols directly scatter and absorb radiation the scattering of radiation causes atmospheric cooling whereas absorption can cause atmospheric warming aerosol indirect effect aerosols modify the properties of clouds through a subset of the aerosol population called cloud condensation nuclei increased nuclei concentrations lead to increased cloud droplet number concentrations which in turn leads to increased cloud albedo increased light scattering and radiative cooling first indirect effect but also leads to reduced precipitation efficiency and increased lifetime of the cloud second indirect effect black carbon another albedorelated effect on the climate is from black carbon particles the size of this effect is difficult to quantify the intergovernmental panel on climate change estimates that the global mean radiative forcing for black carbon aerosols from fossil fuels is 02 w m2 with a range 01 to 04 w m2 black carbon is a bigger cause of the melting of the polar ice cap in the arctic than carbon dioxide due to its effect on the albedo human activities human activities eg deforestation farming and urbanization change the albedo of various areas around the globe however quantification of this effect on the global scale is difficult

4,preeuropean settlement the moundville archaeological site in hale county it was occupied by native americans of the mississippian culture from 1000 to 1450 ad indigenous peoples of varying cultures lived in the area for thousands of years before the advent of european colonization trade with the northeastern tribes by the ohio river began during the burial mound period 1000 bcad 700 and continued until european contact the agrarian mississippian culture covered most of the state from 1000 to 1600 ad with one of its major centers built at what is now the moundville archaeological site in moundville alabama this is the secondlargest complex of the classic middle mississippian era after cahokia in presentday illinois which was the center of the culture analysis of artifacts from archaeological excavations at moundville were the basis of scholars formulating the characteristics of the southeastern ceremonial complex secc contrary to popular belief the secc appears to have no direct links to mesoamerican culture but developed independently the ceremonial complex represents a major component of the religion of the mississippian peoples it is one of the primary means by which their religion is understood among the historical tribes of native american people living in presentday alabama at the time of european contact were the cherokee an iroquoian language people and the muskogeanspeaking alabama alibamu chickasaw choctaw creek and koasati while part of the same large language family the muskogee tribes developed distinct cultures and languages european settlement with exploration in the 16th century the spanish were the first europeans to reach alabama the expedition of hernando de soto passed through mabila and other parts of the state in 1540 more than 160 years later the french founded the regions first european settlement at old mobile in 1702 the city was moved to the current site of mobile in 1711 this area was claimed by the french from 1702 to 1763 as part of la louisiane after the french lost to the british in the seven years war it became part of british west florida from 1763 to 1783 after the united states victory in the american revolutionary war the territory was divided between the united states and spain the latter retained control of this western territory from 1783 until the surrender of the spanish garrison at mobile to us forces on april 13 1813 thomas bassett a loyalist to the british monarchy during the revolutionary era was one of the earliest white settlers in the state outside mobile he settled in the tombigbee district during the early 1770s the districts boundaries were roughly limited to the area within a few miles of the tombigbee river and included portions of what is today southern clarke county northernmost mobile county and most of washington county what is now the counties of baldwin and mobile became part of spanish west florida in 1783 part of the independent republic of west florida in 1810 and was finally added to the mississippi territory in 1812 most of what is now the northern twothirds of alabama was known as the yazoo lands beginning during the british colonial period it was claimed by the province of georgia from 1767 onwards following the revolutionary war it remained a part of georgia although heavily disputed map showing the formation of the mississippi and alabama territories with the exception of the area around mobile and the yazoo lands what is now the lower onethird alabama was made part of the mississippi territory when it was organized in 1798 the yazoo lands were added to the territory in 1804 following the yazoo land scandal spain kept a claim on its former spanish west florida territory in what would become the coastal counties until the adamsonís treaty officially ceded it to the united states in 1819 19th century before mississippis admission to statehood on december 10 1817 the more sparsely settled eastern half of the territory was separated and named the alabama territory the united states congress created the alabama territory on march 3 1817 st stephens now abandoned served as the territorial capital from 1817 to 1819 alabama was admitted as the 22nd state on december 14 1819 with congress selecting huntsville as the site for the first constitutional convention from july 5 to august 2 1819 delegates met to prepare the new state constitution huntsville served as temporary capital from 1819 to 1820 when the seat of government moved to cahaba in dallas county thornhill in greene county it is a former black belt plantation cahaba now a ghost town was the first permanent state capital from 1820 to 1825 alabama fever was underway when the state was admitted to the union with settlers and land speculators pouring into the state to take advantage of fertile land suitable for cotton cultivation part of the frontier in the 1820s and 1830s its constitution provided for universal suffrage for white men southeastern planters and traders from the upper south brought slaves with them as the cotton plantations in alabama expanded the economy of the central black belt named for its dark productive soil was built around large cotton plantations whose owners wealth grew mainly from slave labor the area also drew many poor disfranchised people who became subsistence farmers alabama had an estimated population of under 10000 people in 1810 but it increased to more than 300000 people by 1830 most native american tribes were completely removed from the state within a few years of the passage of the indian removal act by congress in 1830 william nichols it was built from 1827 to 1829 and was destroyed by fire in 1923 from 1826 to 1846 tuscaloosa served as alabamas capital on january 30 1846 the alabama legislature announced it had voted to move the capital city from tuscaloosa to montgomery the first legislative session in the new capital met in december 1847 a new capitol building was erected under the direction of stephen decatur button of philadelphia the first structure burned down in 1849 but was rebuilt on the same site in 1851 this second capitol building in montgomery remains to the present day it was designed by barachias holt of exeter maine by 1860 the population had increased to 964201 people of which nearly half 435080 were enslaved african americans and 2690 were free people of color on january 11 1861 alabama declared its secession from the union after remaining an independent republic for a few days it joined the confederate states of america the confederacys capital was initially at montgomery alabama was heavily involved in the american civil war although comparatively few battles were fought in the state alabama contributed about 120000 soldiers to the war effort union army troops occupying courthouse square in huntsville following its capture and occupation by federal forces in 1864 a company of cavalry soldiers from huntsville alabama joined nathan bedford forrests battalion in hopkinsville kentucky the company wore new uniforms with yellow trim on the sleeves collar and coat tails this led to them being greeted with yellowhammer and the name later was applied to all alabama troops in the confederate army alabamas slaves were freed by the 13th amendment in 1865 alabama was under military rule from the end of the war in may 1865 until its official restoration to the union in 1868 from 1867 to 1874 with most white citizens barred temporarily from voting and freedmen enfranchised many african americans emerged as political leaders in the state alabama was represented in congress during this period by three africanamerican congressmen jeremiah haralson benjamin s turner and james t rapier following the war the state remained chiefly agricultural with an economy tied to cotton during reconstruction state legislators ratified a new state constitution in 1868 that created the states first public school system and expanded womens rights legislators funded numerous public road and railroad projects although these were plagued with allegations of fraud and misappropriation organized insurgent resistance groups tried to suppress the freedmen and republicans besides the shortlived original ku klux klan these included the pale faces knights of the white camellia red shirts and the white league reconstruction in alabama ended in 1874 when the democrats regained control of the legislature and governors office through an election dominated by fraud and violence they wrote another constitution in 1875 and the legislature passed the blaine amendment prohibiting public money from being used to finance religiousaffiliated schools the same year legislation was approved that called for racially segregated schools railroad passenger cars were segregated in 1891 after disfranchising most african americans and many poor whites in the 1901 constitution the alabama legislature passed more jim crow laws at the beginning of the 20th century to impose segregation in everyday life 20th century the developing skyline of birmingham in 1915 the new 1901 constitution of alabama included provisions for voter registration that effectively disenfranchised large portions of the population including nearly all african americans and native americans and tens of thousands of poor whites through making voter registration difficult requiring a poll tax and literacy test the 1901 constitution required racial segregation of public schools by 1903 only 2980 african americans were registered in alabama although at least 74000 were literate this compared to more than 181000 african americans eligible to vote in 1900 the numbers dropped even more in later decades the state legislature passed additional racial segregation laws related to public facilities into the 1950s jails were segregated in 1911 hospitals in 1915 toilets hotels and restaurants in 1928 and bus stop waiting rooms in 1945 while the planter class had persuaded poor whites to vote for this legislative effort to suppress black voting the new restrictions resulted in their disenfranchisement as well due mostly to the imposition of a cumulative poll tax by 1941 whites constituted a slight majority of those disenfranchised by these laws 600000 whites vs 520000 africanamericans nearly all african americans had lost the ability to vote despite numerous legal challenges that succeeded in overturning certain provisions the state legislature would create new ones to maintain disenfranchisement the exclusion of blacks from the political system persisted until after passage of federal civil rights legislation in the 1965 to enforce their constitutional rights as citizens the ruraldominated alabama legislature consistently underfunded schools and services for the disenfranchised african americans but it did not relieve them of paying taxes partially as a response to chronic underfunding of education for african americans in the south the rosenwald fund began funding the construction of what came to be known as rosenwald schools in alabama these schools were designed and the construction partially financed with rosenwald funds which paid onethird of the construction costs the fund required the local community and state to raise matching funds to pay the rest black residents effectively taxed themselves twice by raising additional monies to supply matching funds for such schools which were built in many rural areas they often donated land and labor as well the former mount sinai school in rural autauga county completed in 1919 it was one of the 387 rosenwald schools built in the state beginning in 1913 the first 80 rosenwald schools were built in alabama for africanamerican children a total of 387 schools seven teachers houses and several vocational buildings were completed by 1937 in the state several of the surviving school buildings in the state are now listed on the national register of historic places continued racial discrimination and lynchings agricultural depression and the failure of the cotton crops due to boll weevil infestation led tens of thousands of african americans from rural alabama and other states to seek opportunities in northern and midwestern cities during the early decades of the 20th century as part of the great migration out of the south reflecting this emigration the population growth rate in alabama see historical populations table below dropped by nearly half from 1910 to 1920 at the same time many rural people both white and african american migrated to the city of birmingham to work in new industrial jobs birmingham experienced such rapid growth that it was called the magic city by the 1920s birmingham was the 19thlargest city in the united states and had more than 30 of the states population heavy industry and mining were the basis of its economy its residents were underrepresented for decades in the state legislature which refused to redistrict after each decennial census according to population changes as it was required by the state constitution this did not change until the late 1960s following a lawsuit and court order beginning in the 1940s when the courts started taking the first steps to recognize the voting rights of black voters the alabama legislature took several counter steps designed to disfranchise black voters the legislature passed and the voters ratified as these were mostly white voters a state constitutional amendment that gave local registrars greater latitude to disqualify voter registration applicants black citizens in mobile successfully challenged this amendment as a violation of the fifteenth amendment the legislature also changed the boundaries of tuskegee to a 28sided figure designed to fence out blacks from the city limits the supreme court unanimously held that this racial gerrymandering violated the constitution in 1961 the alabama legislature also intentionally diluted the effect of the black vote by instituting numbered place requirements for local elections industrial development related to the demands of world war ii brought a level of prosperity to the state not seen since before the civil war rural workers poured into the largest cities in the state for better jobs and a higher standard of living one example of this massive influx of workers occurred in mobile between 1940 and 1943 more than 89000 people moved into the city to work for warrelated industries cotton and other cash crops faded in importance as the state developed a manufacturing and service base despite massive population changes in the state from 1901 to 1961 the ruraldominated legislature refused to reapportion house and senate seats based on population as required by the state constitution to follow the results of decennial censuses they held on to old representation to maintain political and economic power in agricultural areas in addition the state legislature gerrymandered the few birmingham legislative seats to ensure election by persons living outside birmingham one result was that jefferson county containing birminghams industrial and economic powerhouse contributed more than onethird of all tax revenue to the state but did not receive a proportional amount in services urban interests were consistently underrepresented in the legislature a 1960 study noted that because of rural domination a minority of about 25 per cent of the total state population is in majority control of the alabama legislature a class action suit initiated on behalf of plaintiffs in lowndes county alabama challenged the state legislatures lack of redistricting for congressional seats in 1962 white v crook judge frank m johnson ordered the state to redistrict united states supreme court cases of baker v carr 1962 and reynolds v sims 1964 ruled that the principle of one man one vote needed to be the basis of both houses of state legislatures as well and that their districts had to be based on population rather than geographic counties as alabama had used for its senate in 1972 for the first time since 1901 the legislature completed the first congressional redistricting based on the decennial census this benefited the urban areas that had developed as well as all in the population who had been underrepresented for more than 60 years other changes were made to implement representative state house and senate districts african americans continued to press in the 1950s and 1960s to end disenfranchisement and segregation in the state through the civil rights movement including legal challenges in 1954 the us supreme court ruled in brown v board of education that public schools had to be desegregated but alabama was slow to comply during the 1960s under governor george wallace alabama resisted compliance with federal demands for desegregation the civil rights movement had notable events in alabama including the montgomery bus boycott 195556 freedom rides in 1961 and 1965 selma to montgomery marches these contributed to congressional passage and enactment of the civil rights act of 1964 and voting rights act of 1965 by the us congress legal segregation ended in the states in 1964 but jim crow customs often continued until specifically challenged in court despite recommendations of a 1973 alabama constitutional commission the state legislature did not approve an amendment to establish home rule for counties there is very limited home rule but the legislature is deeply involved in passing legislation that applies to countylevel functions and policies this both deprives local residents of the ability to govern themselves and distracts the legislature from statewide issues alabama has made some changes since the late 20th century and has used new types of voting to increase representation in the 1980s an omnibus redistricting case dillard v crenshaw county challenged the atlarge voting for representative seats of 180 alabama jurisdictions including counties and school boards atlarge voting had diluted the votes of any minority in a county as the majority tended to take all seats despite african americans making up a significant minority in the state they had been unable to elect any representatives in most of the atlarge jurisdictions as part of settlement of this case five alabama cites and counties including chilton county adopted a system of cumulative voting for election of representatives in multiseat jurisdictions this has resulted in more proportional representation for voters in another form of proportional representation 23 jurisdictions use limited voting as in conecuh county in 1982 limited voting was first tested in conecuh county together use

4,state government state capitol building in montgomery completed in 1851 the foundational document for alabamas government is the alabama constitution which was ratified in 1901 at almost 800 amendments and 310000 words it is by some accounts the worlds longest constitution and is roughly forty times the length of the united states constitution there has been a significant movement to rewrite and modernize alabamas constitution critics argue that alabamas constitution maintains highly centralized power with the state legislature leaving practically no power in local hands most counties do not have home rule any policy changes proposed in different areas of the state must be approved by the entire alabama legislature and frequently by state referendum one criticism of the current constitution claims that its complexity and length intentionally codify segregation and racism the alabama judicial building in montgomery it houses the alabama supreme court alabama court of civil appeals and alabama court of criminal appeals alabamas government is divided into three coequal branches the legislative branch is the alabama legislature a bicameral assembly composed of the alabama house of representatives with 105 members and the alabama senate with 35 members the legislature is responsible for writing debating passing or defeating state legislation the republican party currently holds a majority in both houses of the legislature the legislature has the power to override a gubernatorial veto by a simple majority most state legislatures require a twothirds majority to override a veto until 1964 the state elected state senators on a geographic basis by county with one per county it had not redistricted congressional districts since passage of its constitution in 1901 as a result urbanized areas were grossly underrepresented it had not changed legislative districts to reflect the decennial censuses either in reynolds v sims 1964 the us supreme court implemented the principle of one man one vote ruling that congressional districts had to be reapportioned based on censuses as the state already included in its constitution but had not implemented further the court ruled that both houses of bicameral state legislatures had to be apportioned by population as there was no constitutional basis for states to have geographically based systems at that time alabama and many other states had to change their legislative districting as many across the country had systems that underrepresented urban areas and districts this had caused decades of underinvestment in such areas for instance birmingham and jefferson county taxes had supplied onethird of the state budget but jefferson county received only 167th of state services in funding through the legislative delegations the alabama legislature kept control of county governments governor kay ivey is the current and second female governor of alabama she is the only republican female governor in the states history the executive branch is responsible for the execution and oversight of laws it is headed by the governor of alabama other members of executive branch include the cabinet the attorney general of alabama the alabama secretary of state the alabama state treasurer and the state auditor of alabama the current governor of the state is republican kay ivey the office of lieutenant governor is currently vacant the members of the legislature take office immediately after the november elections statewide officials such as the governor lieutenant governor attorney general and other constitutional officers take office the following january the judicial branch is responsible for interpreting the constitution and applying the law in state criminal and civil cases the states highest court is the supreme court of alabama alabama uses partisan elections to select judges since the 1980s judicial campaigns have become increasingly politicized the current chief justice of the alabama supreme court is republican roy moore all sitting justices on the alabama supreme court are members of the republican party there are two intermediate appellate courts the court of civil appeals and the court of criminal appeals and four trial courts the circuit court trial court of general jurisdiction and the district probate and municipal courts some critics believe that the election of judges has contributed to an exceedingly high rate of executions alabama has the highest per capita death penalty rate in the country in some years it imposes more death sentences than does texas a state which has a population five times larger some of its cases have been highly controversial the supreme court has overturned 24 convictions in death penalty cases it is the only state that still allows judges to override jury decisions in whether or not to use a death sentence in 10 cases judges overturned sentences of life imprisonment without parole lwop that were voted unanimously by juries taxes alabama levies a 2 4 or 5 percent personal income tax depending upon the amount earned and filing status taxpayers are allowed to deduct their federal income tax from their alabama state tax and can do so even if taking the standard deduction taxpayers who file itemized deductions are also allowed to deduct the federal insurance contributions act tax social security and medicare tax the states general sales tax rate is 4 sales tax rates for cities and counties are also added to purchases for example the total sales tax rate in mobile is 10 and there is an additional restaurant tax of 1 which means that a diner in mobile would pay an 11 tax on a meal sales and excise taxes in alabama account for 51 of all state and local revenue compared with an average of about 36 nationwide alabama is one of seven states that levy a tax on food at the same rate as other goods and one of two states the other being neighboring mississippi which fully taxes groceries without any offsetting relief for lowincome families most states exempt groceries from sales tax or apply a lower tax rate alabamas income tax on poor working families is among the highest in the united states alabama is the only state that levies income tax on a family of four with income as low as 4600 which is barely onequarter of the federal poverty line alabamas threshold is the lowest among the 41 states and the district of columbia with income taxes the corporate income tax rate is currently 65 the overall federal state and local tax burden in alabama ranks the state as the second least taxburdened state in the country property taxes are the lowest in the us the current state constitution requires a voter referendum to raise property taxes since alabamas tax structure largely depends on consumer spending it is subject to high variable budget structure for example in 2003 alabama had an annual budget deficit as high as 670 million county and local governments treemap of the popular vote by county 2016 presidential election alabama has 67 counties each county has its own elected legislative branch usually called the county commission it also has limited executive authority in the county because of the constraints of the alabama constitution which centralizes power in the state legislature only seven counties jefferson lee mobile madison montgomery shelby and tuscaloosa in the state have limited home rule instead most counties in the state must lobby the local legislation committee of the state legislature to get simple local policies approved ranging from waste disposal to land use zoning the cumbersome process results in local jurisdictions being unable to manage their problems and the state legislators being buried in local county issues the state legislature has retained power over local governments by refusing to pass a constitutional amendment establishing home rule for counties as recommended by the 1973 alabama constitutional commission legislative delegations retain certain powers over each county united states supreme court decisions in baker v carr 1964 required that both houses have districts established on the basis of population and redistricted after each census in order to implement the principle of one man one vote before that each county was represented by one state senator leading to underrepresentation in the state senate for more urbanized populous counties the rural bias of the state legislature which had also failed to redistrict seats in the state house affected politics well into the 20th century failing to recognize the rise of industrial cities and urbanized areas the lack of home rule for counties in alabama has resulted in the proliferation of local legislation permitting counties to do things not authorized by the state constitution alabamas constitution has been amended more than 700 times and almost onethird of the amendments are local in nature applying to only one county or city a significant part of each legislative session is spent on local legislation taking away time and attention of legislators from issues of statewide importance alabama is an alcoholic beverage control state meaning that the state government holds a monopoly on the sale of alcohol the alabama alcoholic beverage control board controls the sale and distribution of alcoholic beverages in the state

governor since april 10 2017 during reconstruction following the american civil war alabama was occupied by federal troops of the third military district under general john pope in 1874 the political coalition of white democrats known as the redeemers took control of the state government from the republicans in part by suppressing the africanamerican vote through violence fraud and intimidation after 1890 a coalition of white democratic politicians passed laws to segregate and disenfranchise african american residents a process completed in provisions of the 1901 constitution provisions which disenfranchised african americans resulted in excluding many poor whites by 1941 more whites than african americans had been disenfranchised 600000 to 520000 the total effects were greater on the africanamerican community as almost all of its citizens were disfranchised and relegated to separate and unequal treatment under the law from 1901 through the 1960s the state did not redraw election districts as population grew and shifted within the state during urbanization and industrialization of certain areas as counties were the basis of election districts the result was a rural minority that dominated state politics through nearly threequarters of the century until a series of federal court cases required redistricting in 1972 to meet equal representation alabama state politics gained nationwide and international attention in the 1950s and 1960s during the civil rights movement when whites bureaucratically and at times violently resisted protests for electoral and social reform governor george wallace the states only fourterm governor was a controversial figure who vowed to maintain segregation only after passage of the federal civil rights act of 1964 and voting rights act of 1965 did african americans regain the ability to exercise suffrage among other civil rights in many jurisdictions they continued to be excluded from representation by atlarge electoral systems which allowed the majority of the population to dominate elections some changes at the county level have occurred following court challenges to establish singlemember districts that enable a more diverse representation among county boards in 2007 the alabama legislature passed and republican governor bob riley signed a resolution expressing profound regret over slavery and its lingering impact in a symbolic ceremony the bill was signed in the alabama state capitol which housed congress of the confederate states of america in 2010 republicans won control of both houses of the legislature for the first time in 136 years after a nearly complete realignment of political parties who represent different visions in the 21st century elections state elections with the disfranchisement of african americans in 1901 the state became part of the solid south a system in which the democratic party operated as effectively the only viable political party in every southern state for nearly 100 years local and state elections in alabama were decided in the democratic party primary with generally only token republican challengers running in the general election since the mid to late 20th century however there has been a realignment among the two major political parties and white conservatives started shifting to the republican party in alabama majoritywhite districts are now expected to regularly elect republican candidates to federal state and local office members of the nine seats on the alabama supreme court and all ten seats on the state appellate courts are elected to office until 1994 no republicans held any of the court seats in that general election the thenincumbent chief justice of alabama ernest c hornsby refused to leave office after losing the election by approximately 3000 votes to republican perry o hooper sr hornsby sued alabama and defiantly remained in office for nearly a year before finally giving up the seat after losing in court this ultimately led to a collapse of support for democrats at the ballot box in the next three or four election cycles the democrats lost the last of the nineteen court seats in august 2011 with the resignation of the last democrat on the bench in the early 21st century republicans hold all seven of the statewide elected executive branch offices republicans hold six of the eight elected seats on the alabama state board of education in 2010 republicans took large majorities of both chambers of the state legislature giving them control of that body for the first time in 136 years the last remaining statewide democrat who served on the alabama public service commission was defeated in 2012 only two republican lieutenant governors have been elected since the end of reconstruction when republicans generally represented reconstruction government including the newly emancipated freedmen who had gained the franchise the two gop lt governors were steve windom 19992003 and the current lt governor kay ivey who was elected in 2010 and reelected in 2014 local elections many local offices county commissioners boards of education tax assessors tax collectors etc in the state are still held by democrats many rural counties have voters who are majority democrats resulting in local elections being decided in the democratic primary similarly many metropolitan and suburban counties are majorityrepublican and elections are effectively decided in the republican primary although there are exceptions alabamas 67 county sheriffs are elected in partisan atlarge races and democrats still retain the narrow majority of those posts the current split is 35 democrats 31 republicans and one independent fayette however most of the democratic sheriffs preside over rural and less populated

5,the tomb of achilles extant throughout antiquity in troad was venerated by thessalians but also by persian expeditionary forces as well as by alexander the great and the roman emperor caracalla achilles cult was also to be found at other places e g on the island of astypalaea in the sporades in sparta which had a sanctuary in elis and in achills homeland thessaly as well as in the magna graecia cities of tarentum locri and croton accounting for an almost panhellenic cult to the hero the spread and intensity of the heros veneration among the greeks that had settled on the northern coast of the pontus euxinus todays black sea appears to have been remarkable an archaic cult is attested for the milesian colony of olbia as well as for an island in the middle of the black sea today identified with snake island ukrainian зміїний zmiinyi near kiliya ukraine early dedicatory inscriptions from the greek colonies on the black sea graffiti and inscribed clay disks these possibly being votive offerings from olbia the area of berezan island and the tauric chersonese attest the existence of a heroic cult of achilles from the sixth century bc onwards the cult was still thriving in the third century ad when dedicatory stelae from olbia refer to an achilles pontárchēs ποντάρχης roughly lord of the sea or of the pontus euxinus who was invoked as a protector of the city of olbia venerated on par with olympian gods such as the local apollo prostates hermes agoraeus or poseidon pliny the elder 2379 ad in his natural history mentions a port of the achæi and an island of achilles famous for the tomb of that man portus achaeorum insula achillis tumulo eius viri clara situated somewhat nearby olbia and the dnieperbug estuary furthermore at 125 roman miles from this island he places a peninsula which stretches forth in the shape of a sword obliquely called dromos achilleos ἀχιλλέως δρόμος achilléōs drómos the racecourse of achilles and considered the place of the heros exercise or of games instituted by him this last feature of plinys account is considered to be the iconic spit called today tendra or kosa tendra and kosa djarilgatch situated between the mouth of the dnieper and karkinit bay but which is hardly 125 roman miles c 185 km away from the dnieperbug estuary as pliny states to the racecourse he gives a length of 80 miles c 120 km whereas the spit

greek νῆσος μακαρῶν island of the blest the present day measures he gives at this point seem to account for an identification of achillea or leuce with todays snake island plinys contemporary pomponius mela c 43 ad tells that achilles was buried on an island named achillea situated between the borysthenes and the ister adding to the geographical confusion ruins of a square temple measuring 30 meters to a side possibly that dedicated to achilles were discovered by captain kritzikly in 1823 on snake island a second exploration in 1840 showed that the construction of a lighthouse had destroyed all traces of this temple a fifth century bc blackglazed lekythos inscription found on the island in 1840 reads glaukos son of poseidon dedicated me to achilles lord of leuke in another inscription from the fifth or fourth century bc a statue is dedicated to achilles lord of leuke by a citizen of olbia while in a further dedication the city of olbia confirms its continuous maintenance of the islands cult again suggesting its quality as a place of a supraregional hero veneration the heroic cult dedicated to achilles on leuce seems to go back to an account from the lost epic aethiopis according to which after his untimely death thetis had snatched her son from the funeral pyre and removed him to a mythical λεύκη νῆσος leúkē nêsos white island already in the fifth century bc pindar had mentioned a cult of achilles on a bright island φαεννά νᾶσος phaenná nâsos of the black sea while in another of his works pindar would retell the story of the immortalized achilles living on a geographically indefinite island of the blest together with other heroes such as his father peleus and cadmus well known is the connection of these mythological fortunate isles μακαρῶν νῆσοι makárôn nêsoi or the homeric elysium with the stream oceanus which according to greek mythology surrounds the inhabited world which should have accounted for the identification of the northern strands of the euxine with it guy hedreen has found further evidence for this connection of achilles with the northern margin of the inhabited world in a poem by alcaeus speaking of achilles lord of scythia and the opposition of north and south as evoked by achilles fight against the aethiopian prince memnon who in his turn would be removed to his homeland by his mother eos after his death the periplus of the euxine sea c 130 ad gives the following details the greek geographer dionysius periegetes who lived probably during the first century ad wrote that the island was called leuce because the wild animals which live there are white it is said that there in leuce island reside the souls of achilles and other heroes and that they wander through the uninhabited valleys of this island this is how jove rewarded the men who had distinguished themselves through their virtues because through virtue they had acquired everlasting honour similarly others relate the islands name to its white cliffs snakes or birds dwelling there pausanias has been told that the island is covered with forests and full of animals some wild some tame in this island there is also achilles temple and his statue leuce had also a reputation as a place of healing pausanias reports that the delphic pythia sent a lord of croton to be cured of a chest wound ammianus marcellinus attributes the healing to waters aquae on the island a number of important commercial port cities of the greek waters were dedicated to achilles herodotus pliny the elder and strabo reported on the existence of a town achílleion ἀχίλλειον built by settlers from mytilene in the sixth century bc close to the heros presumed burial mound in the troad later attestations point to an achílleion in messenia according to stephanus byzantinus and an achílleios ἀχίλλειος in laconia nicolae densuşianu recognized a connection to achilles in the names of aquileia and of the northern arm of the danube delta called chilia presumably from an older achileii though his conclusion that leuce had sovereign rights over the black sea evokes modern rather than archaic sealaw the kings of epirus claimed to be descended from achilles through his son neoptolemus alexander the great son of the epirote princess olympias could therefore also claim this descent and in many ways strove to be like his great ancestor he is said to have visited the tomb of achilles at achilleion while passing troy in ad 216 the roman emperor caracalla while on his way to war against parthia emulated alexander by holding games around achilles

5,achilles in greek tragedy the greek tragedian aeschylus wrote a trilogy of plays about achilles given the title achilleis by modern scholars the tragedies relate the deeds of achilles during the trojan war including his defeat of hector and eventual death when an arrow shot by paris and guided by apollo punctures his heel extant fragments of the achilleis and other aeschylean fragments have been assembled to produce a workable modern play the first part of the achilleis trilogy the myrmidons focused on the relationship between achilles and chorus who represent the achaean army and try to convince achilles to give up his quarrel with agamemnon only a few lines survive today in platos symposium phaedrus points out that aeschylus portrayed achilles as the lover and patroclus as the beloved phaedrus argues that this is incorrect because achilles being the younger and more beautiful of the two was the beloved who loved his lover so much that he chose to die to revenge him the tragedian sophocles also wrote the lovers of achilles a play with achilles as the main character only a few fragments survive towards the end of the 5th century bc a more negative view of achilles emerges in greek drama euripides refers to achilles in a bitter or ironic tone in hecuba electra and iphigenia in aulis achilles in greek philosophy the philosopher zeno of elea centered one of his paradoxes on an imaginary footrace between swiftfooted achilles and a tortoise by which he attempted to show that achilles could not catch up to a tortoise with a head start and therefore that motion and change were impossible as a student of the monist parmenides and a member of the eleatic school zeno believed time and motion to be illusions achilles in roman and medieval literature the romans who traditionally traced their lineage to troy took a highly negative view of achilles virgil refers to achilles as a savage and a merciless butcher of men while horace portrays achilles ruthlessly slaying women and children other writers such as catullus propertius and ovid represent a second strand of disparagement with an emphasis on achilles erotic career this strand continues in latin accounts of the trojan war by writers such as dictys cretensis and dares phrygius and in benoît de saintemaures roman de troie and guido delle colonnes historia destructionis troiae which remained the most widely read and retold versions of the matter of troy until the 17th century achilles was described by the byzantine chronicler leo the deacon not as hellene but as scythian while according to the byzantine author john malalas his army was made up of a tribe previously known as myrmidons and later as bulgars
6,abraham lincoln painting by george peter alexander healy in 1869 as a young man lincoln was a religious skeptic or in the words of a biographer an iconoclast later in life lincolns frequent use of religious imagery and language might have reflected his own personal beliefs or might have been a device to appeal to his audiences who were mostly evangelical protestants he never joined a church although he frequently attended with his wife however he was deeply familiar with the bible and he both quoted and praised it he was private about his beliefs and respected the beliefs of others lincoln never made a clear profession of christian beliefs however he did believe in an allpowerful god that shaped events and by 1865 was expressing those beliefs in major speeches in the 1840s lincoln subscribed to the doctrine of necessity a belief that asserted the human mind was controlled by some higher power in the 1850s lincoln believed in providence in a general way and rarely used the language or imagery of the evangelicals he regarded the republicanism of the founding fathers with an almost religious reverence when he suffered the death of his son edward lincoln more frequently expressed a need to depend on god the death of his son willie in february 1862 may have caused lincoln to look toward religion for answers and solace after willies death lincoln considered why from a divine standpoint the severity of the war was necessary he wrote at this time that god could have either saved or destroyed the union without a human contest yet the contest began and having begun he could give the final victory to either side any day yet the contest proceeds on the day lincoln was assassinated he reportedly told his wife he desired to visit the holy land

6,several claims abound that lincolns health was declining before the assassination these are often based on photographs appearing to show weight loss and muscle wasting one such claim is that he suffered from a rare genetic disorder men2b which manifests with a medullary thyroid carcinoma mucosal neuromas and a marfanoid appearance others simply claim he had marfan syndrome based on his tall appearance with spindly fingers and the association of possible aortic regurgitation which can cause bobbing of the head demussets sign based on blurring of lincolns head in photographs which back then had a long exposure time dna analysis was being refused by the grand army of the republic museum in philadelphia
6,1860 election and secession on november 6 1860 lincoln was elected the 16th president of the united states beating douglas breckinridge and bell he was the first president from the republican party his victory was entirely due to the strength of his support in the north and west no ballots were cast for him in 10 of the 15 southern slave states and he won only two of 996 counties in all the southern states lincoln received 1866452 votes douglas 1376957 votes breckinridge 849781 votes and bell 588789 votes turnout was 822 percent with lincoln winning the free northern states as well as california and oregon douglas won missouri and split new jersey with lincoln bell won virginia tennessee and kentucky and breckinridge won the rest of the south although lincoln won only a plurality of the popular vote his victory in the electoral college was decisive lincoln had 180 and his opponents added together had only 123 there were fusion tickets in which all of lincolns opponents combined to support the same slate of electors in new york new jersey and rhode island but even if the antilincoln vote had been combined in every state lincoln still would have won a majority in the electoral college the first photographic image of the new president as lincolns election became evident secessionists made clear their intent to leave the union before he took office the next march on december 20 1860 south carolina took the lead by adopting an ordinance of secession by february 1 1861 florida mississippi alabama georgia louisiana and texas followed six of these states then adopted a constitution and declared themselves to be a sovereign nation the confederate states of america the upper south and border states delaware maryland virginia north carolina tennessee kentucky missouri and arkansas listened to but initially rejected the secessionist appeal president buchanan and presidentelect lincoln refused to recognize the confederacy declaring secession illegal the confederacy selected jefferson davis as its provisional president on february 9 1861 there were attempts at compromise the crittenden compromise would have extended the missouri compromise line of 1820 dividing the territories into slave and free contrary to the republican partys freesoil platform lincoln rejected the idea saying i will suffer death before i consent to any concession or compromise which looks like buying the privilege to take possession of this government to which we have a constitutional right lincoln however did tacitly support the proposed corwin amendment to the constitution which passed congress before lincoln came into office and was then awaiting ratification by the states that proposed amendment would have protected slavery in states where it already existed and would have guaranteed that congress would not interfere with slavery without southern consent a few weeks before the war lincoln sent a letter to every governor informing them congress had passed a joint resolution to amend the constitution lincoln was open to the possibility of a constitutional convention to make further amendments to the constitution en route to his inauguration by train lincoln addressed crowds and legislatures across the north the presidentelect then evaded possible assassins in baltimore who were uncovered by lincolns head of security allan pinkerton on february 23 1861 he arrived in disguise in washington dc which was placed under substantial military guard lincoln directed his inaugural address to the south proclaiming once again that he had no intention or inclination to abolish slavery in the southern states the president ended his address with an appeal to the people of the south we are not enemies but friends we must not be enemies the mystic chords of memory stretching from every battlefield and patriot grave to every living heart and hearthstone all over this broad land will yet swell the chorus of the union when again touched as surely they will be by the better angels of our nature the failure of the peace conference of 1861 signaled that legislative compromise was impossible by march 1861 no leaders of the insurrection had proposed rejoining the union on any terms meanwhile lincoln and the republican leadership agreed that the dismantling of the union could not be tolerated lincoln said as the war was ending both parties deprecated war but one of them would make war rather than let the nation survive and the other would accept war rather than let it perish and the war came beginning of the war major anderson ft sumter commander the commander of fort sumter south carolina major robert anderson sent a request for provisions to washington and the execution of lincolns order to meet that request was seen by the secessionists as an act of war on april 12 1861 confederate forces fired on union troops at fort sumter forcing them to surrender and began the war historian allan nevins argued that the newly inaugurated lincoln made three miscalculations underestimating the gravity of the crisis exaggerating the strength of unionist sentiment in the south and not realizing the southern unionists were insisting there be no invasion william tecumseh sherman talked to lincoln during inauguration week and was sadly disappointed at his failure to realize that the country was sleeping on a volcano and that the south was preparing for war historian donald concludes that his repeated efforts to avoid collision in the months between inauguration and the firing on ft sumter showed he adhered to his vow not to be the first to shed fraternal blood but he also vowed not to surrender the forts the only resolution of these contradictory positions was for the confederates to fire the first shot they did just that on april 15 lincoln called on all the states to send detachments totaling 75000 troops to recapture forts protect washington and preserve the union which in his view still existed intact despite the actions of the seceding states this call forced the states to choose sides virginia declared its secession and was rewarded with the confederate capital despite the exposed position of richmond so close to union lines north carolina tennessee and arkansas also voted for secession over the next two months secession sentiment was strong in missouri and maryland but did not prevail kentucky tried to be neutral the confederate attack on fort sumter rallied americans north of the masondixon line to the defense of the american nation historian allan nevins says the thunderclap of sumter produced a startling crystallization of northern sentiment anger swept the land from every side came news of mass meetings speeches resolutions tenders of business support the muster of companies and regiments the determined action of governors and legislatures states sent union regiments south in response to lincolns call to save the capital and confront the rebellion on april 19 mobs in baltimore which controlled the rail links attacked union troops who were changing trains and local leaders groups later burned critical rail bridges to the capital the army responded by arresting local maryland officials lincoln suspended the writ of habeas corpus in areas the army felt it needed to secure for troops to reach washington john merryman a maryland official involved in hindering the us troop movements petitioned supreme court chief justice and marylander roger b taney author of the controversial proslavery dred scott opinion to issue a writ of habeas corpus and in june taney acting as a circuit judge and not speaking for the supreme court issued the writ because in his opinion only congress could suspend the writ lincoln continued the army policy that the writ was suspended in limited areas despite the ex parte merryman ruling war strategy after the battle of fort sumter lincoln realized the importance of taking immediate executive control of the war and making an overall strategy to put down the rebellion lincoln encountered an unprecedented political and military crisis and he responded as commanderinchief using unprecedented powers he expanded his war powers and imposed a blockade on all the confederate shipping ports disbursed funds before appropriation by congress and after suspending habeas corpus arrested and imprisoned thousands of suspected confederate sympathizers lincoln was supported by congress and the northern public for these actions in addition lincoln had to contend with reinforcing strong union sympathies in the border slave states and keeping the war from becoming an international conflict running the machine an 1864 political cartoon satirizing lincolns administrationfeaturing william fessenden edwin stanton william seward gideon welles lincoln and others the war effort was the source of continued disparagement of lincoln and dominated his time and attention from the start it was clear that bipartisan support would be essential to success in the war effort and any manner of compromise alienated factions on both sides of the aisle such as the appointment of republicans and democrats to command positions in the union army copperheads criticized lincoln for refusing to compromise on the slavery issue conversely the radical republicans criticized him for moving too slowly in abolishing slavery on august 6 1861 lincoln signed the confiscation act that authorized judiciary proceedings to confiscate and free slaves who were used to support the confederate war effort in practice the law had little effect but it did signal political support for abolishing slavery in the confederacy in late august 1861 general john c frémont the 1856 republican presidential nominee issued without consulting his superiors in washington a proclamation of martial law in missouri he declared that any citizen found bearing arms could be courtmartialed and shot and that slaves of persons aiding the rebellion would be freed frémont was already under a cloud with charges of negligence in his command of the department of the west compounded with allegations of fraud and corruption lincoln overruled frémonts proclamation lincoln believed that fremonts emancipation was political neither militarily necessary nor legal after lincoln acted union enlistments from maryland kentucky and missouri increased by over 40000 troops lincoln left most diplomatic matters to his secretary of state william seward at times seward was too bellicose so for balance lincoln stuck a close working relationship with senator charles sumner the chairman of the senate foreign relations committee the trent affair of late 1861 threatened war with great britain the us navy had illegally intercepted a british mail ship the trent on the high seas and seized two confederate envoys britain protested vehemently while the us cheered lincoln ended the crisis by releasing the two diplomats biographer james g randall has dissected lincolns successful techniques his restraint his avoidance of any outward expression of truculence his early softening of state departments attitude toward britain his deference toward seward and sumner his withholding of his own paper prepared for the occasion his readiness to arbitrate his golden silence in addressing congress his shrewdness in recognizing that war must be averted and his clear perception that a point could be clinched for americas true position at the same time that full satisfaction was given to a friendly country lincoln painstakingly monitored the telegraphic reports coming into the war department headquarters he kept close tabs on all phases of the military effort consulted with governors and selected generals based on their past success as well as their state and party in january 1862 after many complaints of inefficiency and profiteering in the war department lincoln replaced simon cameron with edwin stanton as war secretary stanton was a staunchly unionist probusiness conservative democrat who moved toward the radical republican faction nevertheless he worked more often and more closely with lincoln than any other senior official stanton and lincoln virtually conducted the war together say thomas and hyman in terms of war strategy lincoln articulated two priorities to ensure that washington was welldefended and to conduct an aggressive war effort that would satisfy the demand in the north for prompt decisive victory major northern newspaper editors expected victory within 90 days twice a week lincoln would meet with his cabinet in the afternoon and occasionally mary lincoln would force him to take a carriage ride because she was concerned he was working too hard lincoln learned from reading the theoretical book of his chief of staff general henry halleck a disciple of the european strategist jomini he began to appreciate the critical need to control strategic points such as the mississippi river lincoln saw the importance of vicksburg and understood the necessity of defeating the enemys army rather than simply capturing territory general mcclellan after the union defeat at the first battle of bull run and the retirement of the aged winfield scott in late 1861 lincoln appointed major general george b mcclellan generalinchief of all the union armies mcclellan a young west point graduate railroad executive and pennsylvania democrat took several months to plan and attempt his peninsula campaign longer than lincoln wanted the campaigns objective was to capture richmond by moving the army of the potomac by boat to the peninsula and then overland to the confederate capital mcclellans repeated delays frustrated lincoln and congress as did his position that no troops were needed to defend washington lincoln insisted on holding some of mcclellans troops in defense of the capital mcclellan who consistently overestimated the strength of confederate troops blamed this decision for the ultimate failure of the peninsula campaign george mcclellan after the battle of antietam in 1862 lincoln removed mcclellan as generalinchief in march 1862 after mcclellans harrisons landing letter in which he offered unsolicited political advice to lincoln urging caution in the war effort the office remained empty until july when henry halleck was selected for it mcclellans letter incensed radical republicans who successfully pressured lincoln to appoint john pope a republican as head of the new army of virginia pope complied with lincolns strategic desire to move toward richmond from the north thus protecting the capital from attack however lacking requested reinforcements from mcclellan now commanding the army of the potomac pope was soundly defeated at the second battle of bull run in the summer of 1862 forcing the army of the potomac to defend washington for a second time the war also expanded with naval operations in 1862 when the css virginia formerly the uss merrimack damaged or destroyed three union vessels in norfolk virginia before being engaged and damaged by the uss monitor lincoln closely reviewed the dispatches and interrogated naval officers during their clash in the battle of hampton roads despite his dissatisfaction with mcclellans failure to reinforce pope lincoln was desperate and restored him to command of all forces around washington to the dismay of all in his cabinet but seward two days after mcclellans return to command general robert e lees forces crossed the potomac river into maryland leading to the battle of antietam in september 1862 the ensuing union victory was among the bloodiest in american history but it enabled lincoln to announce that he would issue an emancipation proclamation in january having composed the proclamation some time earlier lincoln had waited for a military victory to publish it to avoid it being perceived as the product of desperation mcclellan then resisted the presidents demand that he pursue lees retreating and exposed army while his counterpart general don carlos buell likewise refused orders to move the army of the ohio against rebel forces in eastern tennessee as a result lincoln replaced buell with william rosecrans and after the 1862 midterm elections he replaced mcclellan with republican ambrose burnside both of these replacements were political moderates and prospectively more supportive of the commanderinchief battle of may 3 1863 burnside against the advice of the president prematurely launched an offensive across the rappahannock river and was stunningly defeated by lee at fredericksburg in december not only had burnside been defeated on the battlefield but his soldiers were disgruntled and undisciplined desertions during 1863 were in the thousands and they increased after fredericksburg lincoln brought in joseph hooker despite his record of loose talk about the need for a military dictatorship the midterm elections in 1862 brought the republicans severe losses due to sharp disfavor with the administration over its failure to deliver a speedy end to the war as well as rising inflation new high taxes rumors of corruption the suspension of habeas corpus the military draft law and fears that freed slaves would undermine the labor market the emancipation proclamation announced in september gained votes for the republicans in the rural areas of new england and the upper midwest but it lost votes in the cities and the lower midwest while republicans were discouraged democrats were energized and did especially well in pennsylvania ohio indiana and new york the republicans did maintain their majorities in congress and in the major states except new york the cincinnati gazette contended that the voters were depressed by the interminable nature of this war as so far conducted and by the rapid exhaustion of the national resources without progress in the spring of 1863 lincoln was optimistic about upcoming military campaigns to the point of thinking the end of the war could be near if a string of victories could be put together these plans included hookers attack on lee north of richmond rosecrans on chattanooga grants on vicksburg and a naval assault on charleston hooker was routed by lee at the battle of chancellorsville in may but continued to command his troops for some weeks he ignored lincolns order to divide his troops and possibly force lee to do the same in harpers ferry and tendered his resignation which lincoln accepted he was replaced by george meade who followed lee into pennsylvania for the gettysburg campaign which was a victory for the union though lees army avoided capture at the same time after initial setbacks grant laid siege to vicksburg and the union navy attained some success in charleston harbor after the battle of gettysburg lincoln clearly understood that his military decisions would be more effectively carried out by conveying his orders through his war secretary or his generalinchief on to his generals who resented his civilian interference with their own plans even so he often continued to give detailed directions to his generals as commanderinchief emancipation proclamation first reading of the emancipation proclamation of president lincoln by francis bicknell carpenter 1864alta darkhaired bearded middleaged man holding documents is seated among seven other men lincoln understood that the federal governments power to end slavery was limited by the constitution which before 1865 committed the issue to individual states he argued before and during his election that the eventual extinction of slavery would result from preventing its expansion into new us territory at the beginning of the war he also sought to persuade the states to accept compensated emancipation in return for their prohibition of slavery lincoln believed that curtailing slavery in these ways would economically expunge it as envisioned by the founding fathers under the constitution president lincoln rejected two geographically limited emancipation attempts by major general john c frémont in august 1861 and by major general david hunter in may 1862 on the grounds that it was not within their power and it would upset the border states loyal to the union on june 19 1862 endorsed by lincoln congress passed an act banning slavery on all federal territory in july the confiscation act of 1862 was passed which set up court procedures that could free the slaves of anyone convicted of aiding the rebellion although lincoln believed it was not within congresss power to free the slaves within the states he approved the bill in deference to the legislature he felt such action could only be taken by the commanderinchief using war powers granted to the president by the constitution and lincoln was planning to take that action in that month lincoln discussed a draft of the emancipation proclamation with his cabinet in it he stated that as a fit and necessary military measure on january 1 1863 all persons held as slaves in the confederate states will thenceforward and forever be free privately lincoln concluded at this point that the slave base of the confederacy had to be eliminated however copperheads argued that emancipation was a stumbling block to peace and reunification republican editor horace greeley of the highly influential new york tribune fell for the ploy and lincoln refuted it directly in a shrewd letter of august 22 1862 although he said he personally wished all men could be free lincoln stated that the primary goal of his actions as the us president he used the first person pronoun and explicitly refers to his official duty was that of preserving the union the emancipation proclamation issued on september 22 1862 and put into effect on january 1 1863 declared free the slaves in 10 states not then under union control with exemptions specified for areas already under union control in two states lincoln spent the next 100 days preparing the army and the nation for emancipation while democrats rallied their voters in the 1862 offyear elections by warning of the threat freed slaves posed to northern whites once the abolition of slavery in the rebel states became a military objective as union armies advanced south more slaves were liberated until all three million of them in confederate territory were freed lincolns comment on the signing of the proclamation was i never in my life felt more certain that i was doing right than i do in signing this paper for some time lincoln continued earlier plans to set up colonies for the newly freed slaves he commented favorably on colonization in the emancipation proclamation but all attempts at such a massive undertaking failed a few days after emancipation was announced 13 republican governors met at the war governors conference they supported the presidents proclamation but suggested the removal of general george b mcclellan as commander of the union army enlisting former slaves in the military was official government policy after the issuance of the emancipation proclamation by the spring of 1863 lincoln was ready to recruit black troops in more than token numbers in a letter to andrew johnson the military governor of tennessee encouraging him to lead the way in raising black troops lincoln wrote the bare sight of 50000 armed and drilled black soldiers on the banks of the mississippi would end the rebellion at once by the end of 1863 at lincolns direction general lorenzo thomas had recruited 20 regiments of blacks from the mississippi valley frederick douglass once observed of lincoln in his company i was never reminded of my humble origin or of my unpopular color gettysburg address 1863 the speech with the great union victory at the battle of gettysburg in july 1863 and the defeat of the copperheads in the ohio election in the fall lincoln maintained a strong base of party support and was in a strong position to redefine the war effort despite the new york city draft riots the stage was set for his address at the gettysburg battlefield cemetery on november 19 1863 defying lincolns prediction that the world will little note nor long remember what we say here the address became the most quoted speech in american history in 272 words and three minutes lincoln asserted the nation was born not in 1789 but in 1776 conceived in liberty and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal he defined the war as an effort dedicated to these principles of liberty and equality for all the emancipation of slaves was now part of the national war effort he declared that the deaths of so many brave soldiers would not be in vain that slavery would end as a result of the losses and the future of democracy in the world would be assured that government of the people by the people for the people shall not perish from the earth lincoln concluded that the civil war had a profound objective a new birth of freedom in the nation general grant sherman and grant and admiral porter in the peacemakers an 1868 painting of events aboard the river queen in march 1865 meades failure to capture lees army as it retreated from gettysburg and the continued passivity of the army of the potomac persuaded lincoln that a change in command was needed general ulysses s grants victories at the battle of shiloh and in the vicksburg campaign impressed lincoln and made grant a strong candidate to head the union army responding to criticism of grant after shiloh lincoln had said i cant spare this man he fights with grant in command lincoln felt the union army could relentlessly pursue a series of coordinated offensives in multiple theaters and have a top commander who agreed on the use of black troops nevertheless lincoln was concerned that grant might be considering a candidacy for president in 1864 as mcclellan was lincoln arranged for an intermediary to make inquiry into grants political intentions and being assured that he had none submitted to the senate grants promotion to commander of the union army he obtained congresss consent to reinstate for grant the rank of lieutenant general which no officer had held since george washington grant waged his bloody overland campaign in 1864 this is often characterized as a war of attrition given high union losses at battles such as the battle of the wilderness and cold harbor even though they had the advantage of fighting on the defensive the confederate forces had almost as high a percentage of casualties as the union forces the high casualty figures of the union alarmed the north grant had lost a third of his army and lincoln asked what grants plans were to which the general replied i propose to fight it out on this line if it takes all summer the confederacy lacked reinforcements so lees army shrank with every costly battle grants army moved south crossed the james river forcing a siege and trench warfare outside petersburg virginia lincoln then made an extended visit to grants headquarters at city point virginia this allowed the president to confer in person with grant and william tecumseh sherman about the hostilities as sherman coincidentally managed a hasty visit to grant from his position in north carolina lincoln and the republican party mobilized support for the draft throughout the north and replaced the union losses lincoln authorized grant to target the confederate infrastructuresuch as plantations railroads and bridgeshoping to destroy the souths morale and weaken its economic ability to continue fighting grants move to petersburg resulted in the obstruction of three railroads between richmond and the south this strategy allowed generals sherman and philip sheridan to destroy plantations and towns in virginias shenandoah valley the damage caused by shermans march to the sea through georgia in 1864 was limited to a swath but neither lincoln nor his commanders saw destruction as the main goal but rather defeat of the confederate armies mark e neely jr has argued that there was no effort to engage in total war against civilians which he believed did take place during world war ii confederate general jubal early began a series of assaults in the north that threatened the capital during earlys raid on washington dc in 1864 lincoln was watching the combat from an exposed position captain oliver wendell holmes shouted at him get down you damn fool before you get shot after repeated calls on grant to defend washington sheridan was appointed and the threat from early was dispatched as grant continued to wear down lees forces efforts to discuss peace began confederate vice president stephens led a group to meet with lincoln seward and others at hampton roads lincoln refused to allow any negotiation with the confederacy as a coequal his sole objective was an agreement to end the fighting and the meetings produced no results on april 1 1865 grant successfully outflanked lees forces in the battle of five forks and nearly encircled petersburg and the confederate government evacuated richmond days later when that city fell lincoln visited the vanquished confederate capital as he walked through the city white southerners were stonefaced but freedmen greeted him as a hero on april 9 lee surrendered to grant at appomattox and the war was effectively over 1864 reelection while the war was still being waged lincoln faced reelection in 1864 lincoln was a master politician bringing togetherand holding togetherall the main factions of the republican party and bringing in war democrats such as edwin m stanton and andrew johnson as well lincoln spent many hours a week talking to politicians from across the land and using his patronage powersgreatly expanded over peacetimeto hold the factions of his party together build support for his own policies and fend off efforts by radicals to drop him from the 1864 ticket at its 1864 convention the republican party selected johnson a war democrat from the southern state of tennessee as his running mate to broaden his coalition to include war democrats as well as republicans lincoln ran under the label of the new union party when grants 1864 spring campaigns turned into bloody stalemates and union casualties mounted the lack of military success wore heavily on the presidents reelection prospects and many republicans across the country feared that lincoln would be defeated sharing this fear lincoln wrote and signed a pledge that if he should lose the election he would still defeat the confederacy before turning over the white house lincoln did not show the pledge to his cabinet but asked them to sign the sealed envelope while the democratic platform followed the peace wing of the party and called the war a failure their candidate general george b mcclellan supported the war and repudiated the platform lincoln provided grant with more troops and mobilized his party to renew its support of grant in the war effort shermans capture of atlanta in september and david farraguts capture of mobile ended defeatist jitters the democratic party was deeply split with some leaders and most soldiers openly for lincoln by contrast the national union party was united and energized as lincoln made emancipation the central issue and state republican parties stressed the perfidy of the copperheads on november 8 lincoln was reelected in a landslide carrying all but three states and receiving 78 percent of the union soldiers vote on march 4 1865 lincoln delivered his second inaugural address in it he deemed the high casualties on both sides to be gods will historian mark noll concludes it ranks among the small handful of semisacred texts by which americans conceive their place in the world lincoln said reconstruction reconstruction began during the war as lincoln and his associates anticipated questions of how to reintegrate the conquered southern states and how to determine the fates of confederate leaders and freed slaves shortly after lees surrender a general had asked lincoln how the defeated confederates should be treated and lincoln replied let em up easy in keeping with that sentiment lincoln led the moderates regarding reconstruction policy and was opposed by the radical republicans under rep thaddeus stevens sen charles sumner and sen benjamin wade political allies of the president on other issues determined to find a course that would reunite the nation and not alienate the south lincoln urged that speedy elections under generous terms be held throughout the war his amnesty proclamation of december 8 1863 offered pardons to those who had not held a confederate civil office had not mistreated union prisoners and would sign an oath of allegiance a political cartoon of vice president andrew johnson a former tailor and lincoln 1865 entitled the rail splitter at work repairing the union the caption reads johnson take it quietly uncle abe and i will draw it closer than ever lincoln a few more stitches andy and the good old union will be mended as southern states were subdued critical decisions had to be made as to their leadership while their administrations were reformed of special importance were tennessee and arkansas where lincoln appointed generals andrew johnson and frederick steele as military governors respectively in louisiana lincoln ordered general nathaniel p banks to promote a plan that would restore statehood when 10 percent of the voters agreed to it lincolns democratic opponents seized on these appointments to accuse him of using the military to ensure his and the republicans political aspirations on the other hand the radicals denounced his policy as too lenient and passed their own plan the wadedavis bill in 1864 when lincoln vetoed the bill the radicals retaliated by refusing to seat representatives elected from louisiana arkansas and tennessee lincolns appointments were designed to keep both the moderate and radical factions in harness to fill chief justice taneys seat on the supreme court he named the choice of the radicals salmon p chase who lincoln believed would uphold the emancipation and paper money policies after implementing the emancipation proclamation which did not apply to every state lincoln increased pressure on congress to outlaw slavery throughout the entire nation with a constitutional amendment lincoln declared that such an amendment would clinch the whole matter by december 1863 a proposed constitutional amendment that would outlaw slavery was brought to congress for passage this first attempt at an amendment failed to pass falling short of the required twothirds majority on june 15 1864 in the house of representatives passage of the proposed amendment became part of the republicanunionist platform in the election of 1864 after a long debate in the house a second attempt passed congress on january 31 1865 and was sent to the state legislatures for ratification upon ratification it became the thirteenth amendment to the united states constitution on december 6 1865 as the war drew to a close lincolns presidential reconstruction for the south was in flux having believed the federal government had limited responsibility to the millions of freedmen he signed into law senator charles sumners freedmens bureau bill that set up a temporary federal agency designed to meet the immediate material needs of former slaves the law assigned land for a lease of three years with the ability to purchase title for the freedmen lincoln stated that his louisiana plan did not apply to all states under reconstruction shortly before his assassination lincoln announced he had a new plan for southern reconstruction discussions with his cabinet revealed lincoln planned shortterm military control over southern states until readmission under the control of southern unionists historians agree that it is impossible to predict exactly what lincoln would have done about reconstruction if he had lived but they make projections based on his known policy positions and political acumen lincoln biographers james g randall and richard current according to david lincove argue that it is likely that had he lived lincoln would have followed a policy similar to johnsons that he would have clashed with congressional radicals that he would have produced a better result for the freedmen than occurred and that his political skills would have helped him avoid johnsons mistakes eric foner argues that unlike sumner and other radicals lincoln did not see reconstruction as an opportunity for a sweeping political and social revolution beyond emancipation he had long made clear his opposition to the confiscation and redistribution of land he believed as most republicans did in april 1865 that the voting requirements should be determined by the states he assumed that political control in the south would pass to white unionists reluctant secessionists and forwardlooking former confederates but time and again during the war lincoln after initial opposition had come to embrace positions first advanced by abolitionists and radical republicans lincoln undoubtedly would have listened carefully to the outcry for further protection for the former slaves it is entirely plausible to imagine lincoln and congress agreeing on a reconstruction policy that encompassed federal protection for basic civil rights plus limited black suffrage along the lines lincoln proposed just before his death redefining the republic and republicanism lincoln in february 1865 about two months before his death the successful reunification of the states had consequences for the name of the country the term the united states has historically been used sometimes in the plural these united states and other times in the singular without any particular grammatical consistency the civil war was a significant force in the eventual dominance of the singular usage by the end of the 19th century in recent years historians such as harry jaffa herman belz john diggins vernon burton and eric foner have stressed lincolns redefinition of republican values as early as the 1850s a time when most political rhetoric focused on the sanctity of the constitution lincoln redirected emphasis to the declaration of independence as the foundation of american political valueswhat he called the sheet anchor of republicanism the declarations emphasis on freedom and equality for all in contrast to the constitutions tolerance of slavery shifted the debate as diggins concludes regarding the highly influential cooper union speech of early 1860 lincoln presented americans a theory of history that offers a profound contribution to the theory and destiny of republicanism itself his position gained strength because he highlighted the moral basis of republicanism rather than its legalisms nevertheless in 1861 lincoln justified the war in terms of legalisms the constitution was a contract and for one party to get out of a contract all the other parties had to agree and then in terms of the national duty to guarantee a republican form of government in every state burton 2008 argues that lincolns republicanism was taken up by the freedmen as they were emancipated in march 1861 in lincolns first inaugural address he explored the nature of democracy he denounced secession as anarchy and explained that majority rule had to be balanced by constitutional restraints in the american system he said a majority held in restraint by constitutional checks and limitations and always changing easily with deliberate changes of popular opinions and sentiments is the only true sovereign of a free people other enactments lincoln adhered to the whig theory of the presidency which gave congress primary responsibility for writing the laws while the executive enforced them lincoln vetoed only four bills passed by congress the only important one was the wadedavis bill with its harsh program of reconstruction he signed the homestead act in 1862 making millions of acres of governmentheld land in the west available for purchase at very low cost the morrill landgrant colleges act also signed in 1862 provided government grants for agricultural colleges in each state the pacific railway acts of 1862 and 1864 granted federal support for the construction of the united states first transcontinental railroad which was completed in 1869 the passage of the homestead act and the pacific railway acts was made possible by the absence of southern congressmen and senators who had opposed the measures in the 1850s other important legislation involved two measures to raise revenues for the federal government tariffs a policy with long precedent and a new federal income tax in 1861 lincoln signed the second and third morrill tariff the first having become law under james buchanan also in 1861 lincoln signed the revenue act of 1861 creating the first us income tax this created a flat tax of 3 percent on incomes above 800 in current dollar terms which was later changed by the revenue act of 1862 to a progressive rate structure lincoln also presided over the expansion of the federal governments economic influence in several other areas the creation of the system of national banks by the national banking act provided a strong financial network in the country it also established a national currency in 1862 congress created with lincolns approval the department of agriculture in 1862 lincoln sent a senior general john pope to put down the sioux uprising in minnesota presented with 303 execution warrants for convicted santee dakota who were accused of killing innocent farmers lincoln conducted his own personal review of each of these warrants eventually approving 39 for execution one was later reprieved president lincoln had planned to reform federal indian policy in the wake of grants casualties in his campaign against lee lincoln had considered yet another executive call for a military draft but it was never issued in response to rumors of one however the editors of the new york world and the journal of commerce published a false draft proclamation which created an opportunity for the editors and others employed at the publications to corner the gold market lincolns reaction was to send the strongest of messages to the media about such behavior he ordered the military to seize the two papers the seizure lasted for two days lincoln is largely responsible for the institution of the thanksgiving holiday in the united states before lincolns presidency thanksgiving while a regional holiday in new england since the 17th century had been proclaimed by the federal government only sporadically and on irregular dates the last such proclamation had been during james madisons presidency 50 years before in 1863 lincoln declared the final thursday in november of that year to be a day of thanksgiving in june 1864 lincoln approved the yosemite grant enacted by congress which provided unprecedented federal protection for the area now known as yosemite national park judicial appointments supreme court appointments noah haynes swayne 1862 samuel freeman miller 1862 david davis 1862 stephen johnson field 1863 salmon portland chase 1864 chief justice salmon portland chase was lincolns choice to be chief justice of the united states lincolns declared philosophy on court nominations was that we cannot ask a man what he will do and if we should and he should answer us we should despise him for it therefore we must take a man whose opinions are known lincoln made five appointments to the united states supreme court noah haynes swayne nominated january 21 1862 and appointed january 24 1862 was chosen as an antislavery lawyer who was committed to the union samuel freeman miller nominated and appointed on july 16 1862 supported lincoln in the 1860 election and was an avowed abolitionist david davis lincolns campaign

nominated as chief justice and appointed the same day on december 6 1864 lincoln believed chase was an able jurist would support reconstruction legislation and that his appointment united the republican party other judicial appointments lincoln appointed 32 federal judges including four associate justices and one chief justice to the supreme court of the united states and 27 judges to the united states district courts lincoln appointed no judges to the united states circuit courts during his time in office states admitted to the union west virginia admitted to the union june 20 1863

6,lincoln in his late 30s as a member of the us house of representatives photo taken by one of lincolns law students around 1846 from the early 1830s lincoln was a steadfast whig and professed to friends in 1861 to be an old line whig a disciple of henry clay the party including lincoln favored economic modernization in banking protective tariffs to fund internal improvements including railroads and espoused urbanization as well lincoln ran for the whig nomination for illinoiss 7th district of the us house of representatives in 1843 but was defeated by john j hardin however lincoln won support for the principle of rotation whereby hardin would retire after only one term to allow for the nomination of another candidate lincoln hoped that this arrangement would lead to his nomination in 1846 lincoln was indeed elected to the house of representatives in 1846 where he served one twoyear term he was the only whig in the illinois delegation but he showed his party loyalty by participating in almost all votes and making speeches that echoed the party line lincoln in collaboration with abolitionist congressman joshua r giddings wrote a bill to abolish slavery in the district of columbia with compensation for the owners enforcement to capture fugitive slaves and a popular vote on the matter he abandoned the bill when it failed to garner sufficient whig supporters on foreign and military policy lincoln spoke out against the mexicanamerican war which he attributed to president polks desire for military glorythat attractive rainbow that rises in showers of blood lincoln also supported the wilmot proviso which if it had been adopted would have banned slavery in any us territory won from mexico lincoln emphasized his opposition to polk by drafting and introducing his spot resolutions the war had begun with a mexican slaughter of american soldiers in territory disputed by mexico and the us polk insisted that mexican soldiers had invaded our territory and shed the blood of our fellowcitizens on our own soil lincoln demanded that polk show congress the exact spot on which blood had been shed and prove that the spot was on american soil congress never enacted the resolution or even debated it the national papers ignored it and it resulted in a loss of political support for lincoln in his district one illinois newspaper derisively nicknamed him spotty lincoln lincoln later regretted some of his statements especially his attack on the presidential warmaking powers realizing clay was unlikely to win the presidency lincoln who had pledged in 1846 to serve only one term in the house supported general zachary taylor for the whig nomination in the 1848 presidential election taylor won and lincoln hoped to be appointed commissioner of the general land office but that lucrative patronage job went to an illinois rival justin butterfield considered by the administration to be a highly skilled lawyer but in lincolns view an old fossil the administration offered him the consolation prize of secretary or governor of the oregon territory this distant territory was a democratic stronghold and acceptance of the post would have effectively ended his legal and political career in illinois so he declined and resumed his law practice

6,emergence as republican leader the debate over the status of slavery in the territories exacerbated sectional tensions between the slaveholding south and the north and the compromise of 1850 failed to defuse the issue in the early 1850s lincoln supported efforts for sectional mediation and his 1852 eulogy for henry clay focused on the latters support for gradual emancipation and opposition to both extremes on the slavery issue as the 1850s progressed the debate over slavery in the nebraska territory and kansas territory became particularly acrimonious and senator stephen a douglas of illinois proposed popular sovereignty as a compromise measure the proposal would take the issue of slavery out of the hands of congress by allowing the people of each territory to decide the status of slavery themselves the proposal alarmed many northerners who hoped to stop the spread of slavery into the territories despite this northern opposition douglass kansasnebraska act narrowly passed congress in may 1854 for months after its passage lincoln did not publicly comment on the kansasnebraska act but he came to strongly oppose it on october 16 1854 in his peoria speech lincoln declared his opposition to slavery which he repeated en route to the presidency speaking in his kentucky accent with a very powerful voice he said the kansas act had a declared indifference but as i must think a covert real zeal for the spread of slavery i cannot but hate it i hate it because of the monstrous injustice of slavery itself i hate it because it deprives our republican example of its just influence in the world lincolns attacks on the kansasnebraska act marked his return to political life nationally the whigs were irreparably split by the kansasnebraska act and other efforts to compromise on the slavery issue reflecting the demise of his party lincoln would write in 1855 i think i am a whig but others say there are no whigs and that i am an abolitionist i do no more than oppose the extension of slavery drawing on the antislavery portion of the whig party and combining free soil liberty and antislavery democratic party members the new republican party formed as a northern party dedicated to antislavery lincoln resisted early attempts to recruit him to the new party fearing that it would serve as a platform for extreme abolitionists lincoln also still hoped to rejuvenate the ailing whig party though he bemoaned his partys growing closeness with the nativist know nothing movement lincoln was elected to the illinois legislature as whig in the aftermath of the 1854 elections which showed the power and popularity of the movement opposed to the kansasnebraska act lincoln declined to take his seat and instead sought election to the united states senate at that time senators were elected by the state legislature after leading in the first six rounds of voting but unable to obtain a majority lincoln instructed his backers to vote for lyman trumbull trumbull was an antislavery democrat and had received few votes in the earlier ballots his supporters also antislavery democrats had vowed not to support any whig lincolns decision to withdraw enabled his whig supporters and trumbulls antislavery democrats to combine and defeat the mainstream democratic candidate joel aldrich matteson in part due to the ongoing violent political confrontations in the kansas opposition to the kansasnebraska act remained strong in illinois and throughout the north as the 1856 elections approached lincoln abandoned the defunct whig party in favor of the republicans he attended the may 1856 bloomington convention which formally established the illinois republican party the convention platform asserted that congress had the right to regulate slavery in the territories and called for the immediate admission of kansas as a free state lincoln gave the final speech of the convention in which he endorsed the party platform and called for the preservation of the union at the june 1856 republican national convention lincoln received significant support on the vice presidential ballot though the party nominated a ticket of john c frémont and william dayton lincoln strongly supported the republican ticket campaigning for the party throughout illinois the democrats nominated former ambassador james buchanan who had been out of the country since 1853 and thus had avoided the debate over slavery in the territories while the know nothings nominated former whig president millard fillmore in the 1856 elections buchanan defeated both his challengers but frémont won several northern states and republican william henry bissell won election as governor of illinois though lincoln did not himself win office his vigorous campaigning had made him the leading republican in illinois eric foner 2010 contrasts the abolitionists and antislavery radical republicans of the northeast who saw slavery as a sin with the conservative republicans who thought it was bad because it hurt white people and blocked progress foner argues that lincoln was a moderate in the middle opposing slavery primarily because it violated the republicanism principles of the founding fathers especially the equality of all men and democratic selfgovernment as expressed in the declaration of independence a portrait of dred scott lincoln denounced the supreme court decision in dred scott v sandford as part of a conspiracy to extend slavery in march 1857 the supreme court issued its decision in dred scott v sandford chief justice roger b taney opined that blacks were not citizens and derived no rights from the constitution while many democrats hoped that dred scott would end the dispute over slavery in the territories the decision sparked further outrage in the north lincoln denounced the decision alleging it was the product of a conspiracy of democrats to support the slave power lincoln argued the authors of the declaration of independence never intended to say all were equal in color size intellect moral developments or social capacity but they did consider all men created equalequal in certain inalienable rights among which are life liberty and the pursuit of happiness lincolndouglas debates and cooper union speech his debates with stephen douglas over slavery douglas was up for reelection in 1858 and lincoln hoped to defeat the powerful illinois democrat with the former democrat trumbull now serving as a republican senator many in the party felt that a former whig should be nominated in 1858 and lincolns 1856 campaigning and willingness to support trumbull in 1854 had earned him favor in the party some eastern republicans favored the reelection of douglas for the senate in 1858 since he had led the opposition to the lecompton constitution which would have admitted kansas as a slave state but many illinois republicans resented this eastern interference for the first time illinois republicans held a convention to agree upon a senate candidate and lincoln won the partys senate nomination with little opposition accepting the nomination lincoln delivered his house divided speech drawing on a house divided against itself cannot stand i believe this government cannot endure permanently half slave and half free i do not expect the union to be dissolvedi do not expect the house to fallbut i do expect it will cease to be divided it will become all one thing or all the other the speech created an evocative image of the danger of disunion caused by the slavery debate and rallied republicans across the north the stage was then set for the campaign for statewide election of the illinois legislature which would in turn select lincoln or douglas as its us senator on being informed of lincolns nomination douglas stated lincoln is the strong man of the partyand if i beat him my victory will be hardly won the senate campaign featured the seven lincolndouglas debates of 1858 the most famous political debates in american history the principals stood in stark contrast both physically and politically lincoln warned that the slave power was threatening the values of republicanism and accused douglas of distorting the values of the founding fathers that all men are created equal while douglas emphasized his freeport doctrine that local settlers were free to choose whether to allow slavery or not and accused lincoln of having joined the abolitionists the debates had an atmosphere of a prize fight and drew crowds in the thousands lincoln stated douglas popular sovereignty theory was a threat to the nations morality and that douglas represented a conspiracy to extend slavery to free states douglas said that lincoln was defying the authority of the us supreme court and the dred scott decision though the republican legislative candidates won more popular votes the democrats won more seats and the legislature reelected douglas to the senate despite the bitterness of the defeat for lincoln his articulation of the issues gave him a national political reputation in may 1859 lincoln purchased the illinois staatsanzeiger a germanlanguage newspaper which was consistently supportive most of the states 130000 german americans voted democratic but there was republican support that a germanlanguage paper could mobilize in the aftermath of the 1858 election newspapers frequently mentioned lincoln as a potential republican presidential candidate in 1860 with william h seward salmon p chase edward bates and simon cameron looming as rivals for the nomination while lincoln was popular in the midwest he lacked support in the northeast and was unsure as to whether he should seek the presidency in january 1860 lincoln told a group of political allies that he would accept the 1860 presidential nomination if offered and in the following months several local papers endorsed lincoln for president on february 27 1860 new york party leaders invited lincoln to give a speech at cooper union to a group of powerful republicans lincoln argued that the founding fathers had little use for popular sovereignty and had repeatedly sought to restrict slavery lincoln insisted the moral foundation of the republicans required opposition to slavery and rejected any groping for some middle ground between the right and the wrong despite his inelegant appearancemany in the audience thought him awkward and even uglylincoln demonstrated an intellectual leadership that brought him into the front ranks of the party and into contention for the republican presidential nomination

may 910 1860 the illinois republican state convention was held in decatur lincolns followers organized a campaign team led by david davis norman judd leonard swett and jesse dubois and lincoln received his first endorsement to run for the presidency exploiting the embellished legend of his frontier days with his father clearing the land and splitting fence rails with an ax lincolns supporters adopted the label of the rail candidate in 1860 lincoln described himself i am in height six feet four inches nearly lean in flesh weighing on an average one hundred and eighty pounds dark

friends promised and manipulated and won the nomination on the third ballot beating candidates such as seward and chase a former democrat hannibal hamlin of maine was nominated for vice president to balance the ticket lincolns success depended on his reputation as a moderate on the slavery issue and his strong support for whiggish programs of internal improvements and the protective tariff on the third ballot pennsylvania put him over the top pennsylvania iron interests were reassured by his support for protective tariffs lincolns managers had been adroitly focused on this delegation as well as the others while following lincolns strong dictate to make no contracts that bind me most republicans agreed with lincoln that the north was the aggrieved party as the slave power tightened its grasp on the national government with the dred scott decision and the presidency of james buchanan throughout the 1850s lincoln doubted the prospects of civil war and his supporters rejected claims that his election would incite secession meanwhile douglas was selected as the candidate of the northern democrats delegates from 11 slave states walked out of the democratic convention disagreeing with douglas position on popular sovereignty and ultimately selected incumbent vice president john c breckinridge as their candidate a group of former whigs and know nothings formed the constitutional union party and nominated john bell of tennessee lincoln and douglas would compete for votes in the north while bell and breckinridge primarily found support in the south prior to the republican convention the lincoln campaign began cultivating a nationwide teen and young adult organization the wide awakes which it used to generate popular support for lincoln throughout the country to spearhead large voter registration drives knowing that new voters and young voters tend to embrace new and young parties as lincolns ideas of abolishing slavery grew so did his supporters people of the northern states knew the southern states would vote against lincoln because of his ideas of antislavery and took action to rally supporters for lincoln as douglas and the other candidates went through with their campaigns lincoln was the only one of them who gave no speeches instead he monitored the campaign closely and relied on the enthusiasm of the republican party the party did the leg work that produced majorities across the north and produced an abundance of campaign posters leaflets and newspaper editorials there were thousands of republican speakers who focused first on the party platform and second on lincolns life story emphasizing his childhood poverty the goal was to demonstrate the superior power of free labor whereby a common farm boy could work his way to the top by his own efforts the republican partys production of campaign literature dwarfed the combined opposition a chicago tribune writer produced a pamphlet that detailed lincolns life and sold 100000 to 200000 copies

6,early life and ancestry abraham lincoln was born february 12 1809 the second child of thomas and nancy hanks lincoln in a oneroom log cabin on the sinking spring farm near hodgenville kentucky he was a descendant of samuel lincoln an englishman who migrated from hingham norfolk to its namesake of hingham massachusetts in 1638 samuels grandson and greatgrandson began the familys western migration which passed through new jersey pennsylvania and virginia lincolns paternal grandfather and namesake captain abraham lincoln moved the family from virginia to jefferson county kentucky in the 1780s captain lincoln was killed in an indian raid in 1786 his children including eightyearold thomas the future presidents father witnessed the attack after his fathers murder thomas was left to make his own way on the frontier working at odd jobs in kentucky and in tennessee before settling with members of his family in hardin county kentucky in the early 1800s lincolns mother nancy is widely assumed to have been the daughter of lucy hanks although no record of nancy hanks birth has ever been found according to william ensign lincolns book the ancestry of abraham lincoln nancy was the daughter of joseph hanks however the debate continues over whether she was born out of wedlock still another researcher adin baber claims that nancy hanks was the daughter of abraham hanks and sarah harper of virginia thomas lincoln and nancy hanks were married on june 12 1806 in washington county and moved to elizabethtown kentucky following their marriage they became the parents of three children sarah born on february 10 1807 abraham on february 12 1809 and another son thomas who died in infancy thomas lincoln bought or leased several farms in kentucky including the sinking spring farm where abraham was born however a land title dispute soon forced the lincolns to move in 1811 the family moved eight miles 13 km north to knob creek farm where thomas acquired title to of land in 1815 a claimant in another land dispute sought to eject the family from the farm of the 8165 acres 330 ha that thomas held in kentucky he lost all but of his land in court disputes over property titles frustrated over the lack of security provided by the kentucky title survey system in the courts thomas sold the remaining land he held in kentucky in 1814 and began planning a move to indiana where the land survey process was more reliable and the ability for an individual to retain land titles was more secure in 1816 the family moved north across the ohio river to indiana a free nonslaveholding territory where they settled in an unbroken forest in hurricane township perry county their land in southern indiana became part of spencer county indiana when the county was established in 1818 the farm is preserved as part of the lincoln boyhood national memorial in 1860 lincoln noted that the familys move to indiana was partly on account of slavery but mainly due to land title difficulties in kentucky during the familys years in kentucky and indiana thomas lincoln worked as a farmer cabinetmaker and carpenter he owned farms several town lots and livestock paid taxes sat on juries appraised estates served on country slave patrols and guarded prisoners thomas and nancy lincoln were also members of a separate baptists church which had restrictive moral standards and opposed alcohol dancing and slavery within a year of the familys arrival in indiana thomas claimed title to of indiana land despite some financial challenges he eventually obtained clear title to of land in what became known as the little pigeon creek community in spencer county prior to the familys move to illinois in 1830 thomas had acquired an additional twenty acres of land adjacent to his property young lincoln by alta statue of young lincoln sitting on a stump holding a book open on his lap several significant family events took place during lincolns youth in indiana on october 5 1818 nancy lincoln died of milk sickness leaving elevenyearold sarah in charge of a household that included her father nineyearold abraham and dennis hanks nancys nineteenyearold orphaned cousin on december 2 1819 lincolns father married sarah sally bush johnston a widow from elizabethtown kentucky with three children of her own abraham became very close to his stepmother whom he referred to as mother those who knew lincoln as a teenager later recalled him being very distraught over his sister sarahs death on january 20 1828 while giving birth to a stillborn son as a youth lincoln disliked the hard labor associated with frontier life some of his neighbors and family members thought for a time that he was lazy for all his reading scribbling writing ciphering writing poetry etc and must have done it to avoid manual labor his stepmother also acknowledged he did not enjoy physical labor but loved to read lincoln was largely selfeducated his formal schooling from several itinerant teachers was intermittent the aggregate of which may have amounted to less than a year however he was an avid reader and retained a lifelong interest in learning family neighbors and schoolmates of lincolns youth recalled that he read and reread the king james bible aesops fables bunyans the pilgrims progress defoes robinson crusoe weemss the life of washington and franklins autobiography among others as he grew into his teens lincoln took responsibility for the chores expected of him as one of the boys in the household he also complied with the customary obligation of a son giving his father all earnings from work done outside the home until the age of twentyone abraham became adept at using an axe tall for his age lincoln was also strong and athletic he attained a reputation for brawn and audacity after a very competitive wrestling match with the renowned leader of a group of ruffians known as the clarys grove boys in early march 1830 partly out of fear of a milk sickness outbreak along the ohio river several members of the extended lincoln family moved west to illinois a nonslaveholding state and settled in macon county west of decatur historians disagree on who initiated the move thomas lincoln had no obvious reason to leave indiana and one possibility is that other members of the family including dennis hanks might not have attained the stability and steady income that thomas lincoln had after the family relocated to illinois abraham became increasingly distant from his father in part because of his fathers lack of education and occasionally lent him money in 1831 as thomas and other members of the family prepared to move to a new homestead in coles county illinois abraham was old enough to make his own decisions and struck out on his own traveling down the sangamon river he ended up in the village of new salem in sangamon county later that spring denton offutt a new salem merchant hired lincoln and some friends to take goods by flatboat from new salem to new orleans via the sangamon illinois and mississippi rivers after arriving in new orleansand witnessing slavery firsthandlincoln returned to new salem where he remained for the next six years marriage and children according to some sources lincolns first romantic interest was ann rutledge whom he met when he first moved to new salem these sources indicate that by 1835 they were in a relationship but not formally engaged she died at the age of 22 on august 25 1835 most likely of typhoid fever in the early 1830s he met mary owens from kentucky when she was visiting her sister late in 1836 lincoln agreed to a match with mary if she returned to new salem mary did return in november 1836 and lincoln courted her for a time however they both had second thoughts about their relationship on august 16 1837 lincoln wrote mary a letter suggesting he would not blame her if she ended the relationship she never replied and the courtship ended in 1840 lincoln became engaged to mary todd who was from a wealthy slaveholding family in lexington kentucky they met in springfield illinois in december 1839 and were engaged the following december a wedding set for january 1 1841 was canceled when the two broke off their engagement at lincolns initiative they later met again at a party and married on november 4 1842 in the springfield mansion of marys married sister while preparing for the nuptials and feeling anxiety again lincoln when asked where he was going replied to hell i suppose in 1844 the couple bought a house in springfield near lincolns law office mary todd lincoln kept house often with the help of a relative or hired servant girl he was an affectionate though often absent husband and father of four children robert todd lincoln was born in 1843 and edward baker lincoln eddie in 1846 edward died on february 1 1850 in springfield probably of tuberculosis willie lincoln was born on december 21 1850 and died of a fever on february 20 1862 the lincolns fourth son thomas tad lincoln was born on april 4 1853 and died of heart failure at the age of 18 on july 16 1871 robert was the only child to live to adulthood and have children the lincolns last descendant greatgrandson robert todd lincoln beckwith died in 1985 lincoln was remarkably fond of children and the lincolns were not considered to be strict with their own the deaths of their sons had profound effects on both parents later in life mary struggled with the stresses of losing her husband and sons and robert lincoln committed her temporarily to a mental health asylum in 1875 abraham lincoln suffered from melancholy a condition which now is referred to as clinical depression lincolns fatherinlaw and others of the todd family were either slave owners or slave traders lincoln was close to the todds and he and his family occasionally visited the todd estate in lexington during his term as president of the united states of america mary was known to cook for lincoln often since she was raised by a wealthy family her cooking abilities were simple but satisfied lincolns tastes which included particularly imported oysters
6,lincoln in 1857 lincoln returned to practicing law in springfield handling every kind of business that could come before a prairie lawyer twice a year for 16 years 10 weeks at a time he appeared in county seats in the midstate region when the county courts were in session lincoln handled many transportation cases in the midst of the nations western expansion particularly the conflicts arising from the operation of river barges under the many new railroad bridges as a riverboat man lincoln initially favored those interests but ultimately represented whoever hired him in fact he later represented a bridge company against a riverboat company in a landmark case involving a canal boat that sank after hitting a bridge in 1849 he received a patent for a flotation device for the movement of boats in shallow water the idea was never commercialized but lincoln is the only president to hold a patent in 1851 he represented the alton sangamon railroad in a dispute with one of its shareholders james a barret who had refused to pay the balance on his pledge to buy shares in the railroad on the grounds that the company had changed its original train route lincoln successfully argued that the railroad company was not bound by its original charter extant at the time of barrets pledge the charter was amended in the public interest to provide a newer superior and less expensive route and the corporation retained the right to demand barrets payment the decision by the illinois supreme court has been cited by numerous other courts in the nation lincoln appeared before the illinois supreme court in 175 cases in 51 as sole counsel of which 31 were decided in his favor from 1853 to 1860 another of lincolns largest clients was the illinois central railroad lincolns reputation with clients gave rise to his nickname honest abe lincolns most notable criminal trial occurred in 1858 when he defended william duff armstrong who was on trial for the murder of james preston metzker the case is famous for lincolns use of a fact established by judicial notice in order to challenge the credibility of an eyewitness after an opposing witness testified seeing the crime in the moonlight lincoln produced a farmers almanac showing the moon was at a low angle drastically reducing visibility based on this evidence armstrong was acquitted lincoln rarely raised objections in the courtroom but in an 1859 case where he defended a cousin peachy harrison who was accused of stabbing another to death lincoln angrily protested the judges decision to exclude evidence favorable to his client instead of holding lincoln in contempt of court as was expected the judge a democrat reversed his ruling allowing the evidence and acquitting harrison
7,aristotle aristotélēs 384322 bc was an ancient greek philosopher and scientist born in the city of stagira chalkidice on the northern periphery of classical greece his father nicomachus died when aristotle was a child whereafter proxenus of atarneus became his guardian at seventeen or eighteen years of age he joined platos academy in athens and remained there until the age of thirtyseven c 347 bc his writings cover many subjects including physics biology zoology metaphysics logic ethics aesthetics poetry theater music rhetoric linguistics politics and government and constitute the first comprehensive system of western philosophy shortly after plato died aristotle left athens and at the request of philip ii of macedon tutored alexander the great beginning in 343 bc teaching alexander the great gave aristotle many opportunities and an abundance of supplies he established a library in the lyceum which aided in the production of many of his hundreds of books which were written on papyrus scrolls the fact that aristotle was a pupil of plato contributed to his former views of platonism but following platos death aristotle immersed himself in empirical studies and shifted from platonism to empiricism he believed all peoples concepts and all of their knowledge was ultimately based on perception aristotles views on natural sciences represent the groundwork underlying many of his works aristotles views on physical science profoundly shaped medieval scholarship their influence extended from late antiquity and the early middle ages into the renaissance and were not replaced systematically until the enlightenment and theories such as classical mechanics some of aristotles zoological observations such as on the hectocotyl reproductive arm of the octopus were not confirmed or refuted until the 19th century his works contain the earliest known formal study of logic which was incorporated in the late 19th century into modern formal logic in metaphysics aristotelianism profoundly influenced jewish and islamic philosophical and theological thought during the middle ages and continues to influence christian theology especially the neoplatonism of the early church and the scholastic tradition of the roman catholic church aristotle was well known among medieval muslim scholars and has been revered as the first teacher his ethics though always influential gained renewed interest with the modern advent of virtue ethics all aspects of aristotles philosophy continue to be the object of active academic study today though aristotle wrote many elegant treatises and dialogues cicero described his literary style as a river of gold it is thought that only around a third of his original output has survived

7,logic aristotle as portrayed in the 1493 nuremberg chronicle with the prior analytics aristotle is credited with the earliest study of formal logic and his conception of it was the dominant form of western logic until 19th century advances in mathematical logic kant stated in the critique of pure reason preface to the second edition 1787 that with aristotle logic reached its completion history aristotle says that on the subject of reasoning he had nothing else on an earlier date to speak of however plato reports that syntax was devised before him by prodicus of ceos who was concerned by the correct use of words logic seems to have emerged from dialectics the earlier philosophers made frequent use of concepts like reductio ad absurdum in their discussions but never truly understood the logical implications even plato had difficulties with logic although he had a reasonable conception of a deductive system he could never actually construct one thus he relied instead on his dialectic plato believed that deduction would simply follow from premises hence he focused on maintaining solid premises so that the conclusion would logically follow consequently plato realized that a method for obtaining conclusions would be most beneficial he never succeeded in devising such a method but his best attempt was published in his book sophist where he introduced his division method analytics and the organon what we today call aristotelian logic aristotle himself would have labeled analytics the term logic he reserved to mean dialectics most of aristotles work is probably not in its original form because it was most likely edited by students and later lecturers the logical works of aristotle were compiled into six books in about the early 1st century ce categories on interpretation prior analytics posterior analytics topics on sophistical refutations the order of the books or the teachings from which they are composed is not certain but this list was derived from analysis of aristotles writings it goes from the basics the analysis of simple terms in the categories the analysis of propositions and their elementary relations in on interpretation to the study of more complex forms namely syllogisms in the analytics and dialectics in the topics and sophistical refutations the first three treatises form the core of the logical theory stricto sensu the grammar of the language of logic and the correct rules of reasoning there is one volume of aristotles concerning logic not found in the organon namely the fourth book of metaphysics aristotles epistemology plato left and aristotle right a detail of the school of athens a fresco by raphael aristotle gestures to the earth representing his belief in knowledge through empirical observation and experience while holding a copy of his nicomachean ethics in his hand whilst plato gestures to the heavens representing his belief in the forms while holding a copy of timaeus ancient roman mosaic depicting aristotle römischgermanisches museum koln germany like his teacher plato aristotles philosophy aims at the universal aristotles ontology however finds the universal in particular things which he calls the essence of things while in platos ontology the universal exists apart from particular things and is related to them as their prototype or exemplar for aristotle therefore epistemology is based on the study of particular phenomena and rises to the knowledge of essences while for plato epistemology begins with knowledge of universal forms or ideas and descends to knowledge of particular imitations of these for aristotle form still refers to the unconditional basis of phenomena but is instantiated in a particular substance see universals and particulars below in a certain sense aristotles method is both inductive and deductive while platos is essentially deductive from a priori principles in aristotles terminology natural philosophy is a branch of philosophy examining the phenomena of the natural world and includes fields that would be regarded today as physics biology and other natural sciences in modern times the scope of philosophy has become limited to more generic or abstract inquiries such as ethics and metaphysics in which logic plays a major role todays philosophy tends to exclude empirical study of the natural world by means of the scientific method in contrast aristotles philosophical endeavors encompassed virtually all facets of intellectual inquiry in the larger sense of the word aristotle makes philosophy coextensive with reasoning which he also would describe as science note however that his use of the term science carries a different meaning than that covered by the term scientific method for aristotle all science dianoia is either practical poetical or theoretical metaphysics 1025b25 by practical science he means ethics and politics by poetical science he means the study of poetry and the other fine arts by theoretical science he means physics mathematics and metaphysics if logic or analytics is regarded as a study preliminary to philosophy the divisions of aristotelian philosophy would consist of 1 logic 2 theoretical philosophy including metaphysics physics and mathematics 3 practical philosophy and 4 poetical philosophy in the period between his two stays in athens between his times at the academy and the lyceum aristotle conducted most of the scientific thinking and research for which he is renowned today in fact most of aristotles life was devoted to the study of the objects of natural science aristotles metaphysics contains observations on the nature of numbers but he made no original contributions to mathematics he did however perform original research in the natural sciences eg botany zoology physics astronomy chemistry meteorology and several other sciences aristotles writings on science are largely qualitative as opposed to quantitative beginning in the 16th century scientists began applying mathematics to the physical sciences and aristotles work in this area was deemed hopelessly inadequate his failings were largely due to the absence of concepts like mass velocity force and temperature he had a conception of speed and temperature but no quantitative understanding of them which was partly due to the absence of basic experimental devices like clocks and thermometers his writings provide an account of many scientific observations a mixture of precocious accuracy and curious errors for example in his history of animals he claimed that human males have more teeth than females in a similar vein john philoponus and later galileo showed by simple experiments that aristotles theory that a heavier object falls faster than a lighter object is incorrect on the other hand aristotle refuted democrituss claim that the milky way was made up of those stars which are shaded by the earth from the suns rays pointing out correctly even if such reasoning was bound to be dismissed for a long time that given current astronomical demonstrations that the size of the sun is greater than that of the earth and the distance of the stars from the earth many times greater than that of the sun then the sun shines on all the stars and the earth screens none of them aristotle also had some scientific blind spots he posited a geocentric cosmology that we may discern in selections of the metaphysics which was widely accepted up until the 16th century from the 3rd century to the 16th century the dominant view held that the earth was the rotational center of the universe because he was perhaps the philosopher most respected by european thinkers during and after the renaissance these thinkers often took aristotles erroneous positions as given which held back science in this epoch however aristotles scientific shortcomings should not mislead one into forgetting his great advances in the many scientific fields for instance he founded logic as a formal science and created foundations to biology that were not superseded for two millennia moreover he introduced the fundamental notion that nature is composed of things that change and that studying such changes can provide useful knowledge of underlying constants geology as quoted from charles lyells principles of geology he aristotle refers to many examples of changes now constantly going on and insists emphatically on the great results which they must produce in the lapse of ages he instances particular cases of lakes that had dried up and deserts that had at length become watered by rivers and fertilized he points to the growth of the nilotic delta since the time of homer to the shallowing of the palus maeotis within sixty years from his own time he alludes to the upheaving of one of the eolian islands previous to a volcanic eruption the changes of the earth he says are so slow in comparison to the duration of our lives that they are overlooked and the migrations of people after great catastrophes and their removal to other regions cause the event to be forgotten he says 12th chapter of his meteorics the distribution of land and sea in particular regions does not endure throughout all time but it becomes sea in those parts where it was land and again it becomes land where it was sea and there is reason for thinking that these changes take place according to a certain system and within a certain period the concluding observation is as follows as time never fails and the universe is eternal neither the tanais nor the nile can have flowed for ever the places where they rise were once dry and there is a limit to their operations but there is none to time so also of all other rivers they spring up and they perish and the sea also continually deserts some lands and invades others the same tracts therefore of the earth are not some always sea and others always continents but every thing changes in the course of time physics five elements aristotle proposed a fifth element aether in addition to the four proposed earlier by empedocles earth which is cold and dry this corresponds to the modern idea of a solid water which is cold and wet this corresponds to the modern idea of a liquid air which is hot and wet this corresponds to the modern idea of a gas fire which is hot and dry this corresponds to the modern ideas of plasma and heat aether which is the divine substance that makes up the heavenly spheres and heavenly bodies stars and planets each of the four earthly elements has its natural place all that is earthly tends toward the center of the universe ie the center of the earth water tends toward a sphere surrounding the center air tends toward a sphere surrounding the water sphere fire tends toward the lunar sphere in which the moon orbits when elements are moved out of their natural place they naturally move back towards it this is natural motion motion requiring no extrinsic cause so for example in water earthy bodies sink while air bubbles rise up in air rain falls and flame rises outside all the other spheres the heavenly fifth element manifested in the stars and planets moves in the perfection of circles motion aristotle defined motion as the actuality of a potentiality as such aquinas suggested that the passage be understood literally that motion can indeed be understood as the active fulfillment of a potential as a transition toward a potentially possible state because actuality and potentiality are normally opposites in aristotle other commentators either suggest that the wording which has come down to us is erroneous or that the addition of the as such to the definition is critical to understanding it causality the four causes aristotle suggested that the reason for anything coming about can be attributed to four different types of simultaneously active factors his name aitia is traditionally translated as cause but it does not always refer to temporal sequence it might be better translated as explanation but the traditional rendering will be employed here material cause describes the material out of which something is composed thus the material cause of a table is wood and the material cause of a car is rubber and steel it is not about action it does not mean that one domino knocks over another domino the formal cause is its form ie the arrangement of that matter it tells us what a thing is that any thing is determined by the definition form pattern essence whole synthesis or archetype it embraces the account of causes in terms of fundamental principles or general laws as the whole ie macrostructure is the cause of its parts a relationship known as the wholepart causation plainly put the formal cause is the idea existing in the first place as exemplar in the mind of the sculptor and in the second place as intrinsic determining cause embodied in the matter formal cause could only refer to the essential quality of causation a simple example of the formal cause is the mental image or idea that allows an artist architect or engineer to create a drawing the efficient cause is the primary source or that from which the change under consideration proceeds it identifies what makes of what is made and what causes change of what is changed and so suggests all sorts of agents nonliving or living acting as the sources of change or movement or rest representing the current understanding of causality as the relation of cause and effect this covers the modern definitions of cause as either the agent or agency or particular events or states of affairs so take the two dominoes this time of equal weighting the first is knocked over causing the second also to fall over the final cause telos is its purpose or that for the sake of which a thing exists or is done including both purposeful and instrumental actions and activities the final cause is the purpose or function that something is supposed to serve this covers modern ideas of motivating causes such as volition need desire ethics or spiritual beliefs additionally things can be causes of one another causing each other reciprocally as hard work causes fitness and vice versa although not in the same way or function the one is as the beginning of change the other as the goal thus aristotle first suggested a reciprocal or circular causality as a relation of mutual dependence or influence of cause upon effect moreover aristotle indicated that the same thing can be the cause of contrary effects its presence and absence may result in different outcomes simply it is the goal or purpose that brings about an event our two dominoes require someone or something to intentionally knock over the first domino because it cannot fall of its own accord aristotle marked two modes of causation proper prior causation and accidental chance causation all causes both proper and incidental can be spoken of as actual or potential and as generic or particular the same language refers to the effects of causes so that actual effects are assigned to operating causes generic effects to generic causes and particular effects to particular causes optics aristotle held more accurate theories on some optical concepts than other philosophers of his day the second oldest written evidence of a camera obscura after mozi c 400 bc can be found in aristotles documentation of such a device in 350 bc in problemata aristotles apparatus contained a dark chamber that had a single small hole or aperture to allow for sunlight to enter aristotle used the device to make observations of the sun and noted that no matter what shape the hole was the sun would still be correctly displayed as a round object in modern cameras this is analogous to the diaphragm aristotle also made the observation that when the distance between the aperture and the surface with the image increased the image was magnified chance and spontaneity according to aristotle spontaneity and chance are causes of some things distinguishable from other types of cause chance as an incidental cause lies in the realm of accidental things it is from what is spontaneous but note that what is spontaneous does not come from chance for a better understanding of aristotles conception of chance it might be better to think of coincidence something takes place by chance if a person sets out with the intent of having one thing take place but with the result of another thing not intended taking place for example a person seeks donations that person may find another person willing to donate a substantial sum however if the person seeking the donations met the person donating not for the purpose of collecting donations but for some other purpose aristotle would call the collecting of the donation by that particular donator a result of chance it must be unusual that something happens by chance in other words if something happens all or most of the time we cannot say that it is by chance there is also more specific kind of chance which aristotle names luck that can only apply to human beings because it is in the sphere of moral actions according to aristotle luck must involve choice and thus deliberation and only humans are capable of deliberation and choice what is not capable of action cannot do anything by chance metaphysics aristotle defines metaphysics as the knowledge of immaterial being or of being in the highest degree of abstraction he refers to metaphysics as first philosophy as well as the theologic science substance potentiality and actuality aristotle examines the concepts of substance and essence ousia in his metaphysics book vii and he concludes that a particular substance is a combination of both matter and form in book viii he distinguishes the matter of the substance as the substratum or the stuff of which it is composed for example the matter of a house is the bricks stones timbers etc or whatever constitutes the potential house while the form of the substance is the actual house namely covering for bodies and chattels or any other differentia see also predicables that let us define something as a house the formula that gives the components is the account of the matter and the formula that gives the differentia is the account of the form with regard to the change kinesis and its causes now as he defines in his physics and on generation and corruption 319b320a he distinguishes the coming to be from growth and diminution which is change in quantity locomotion which is change in space and alteration which is change in quality the coming to be is a change where nothing persists of which the resultant is a property in that particular change he introduces the concept of potentiality dynamis and actuality entelecheia in association with the matter and the form referring to potentiality this is what a thing is capable of doing or being acted upon if the conditions are right and it is not prevented by something else for example the seed of a plant in the soil is potentially dynamei plant and if is not prevented by something it will become a plant potentially beings can either act poiein or be acted upon paschein which can be either innate or learned for example the eyes possess the potentiality of sight innate being acted upon while the capability of playing the flute can be possessed by learning exercise acting actuality is the fulfillment of the end of the potentiality because the end telos is the principle of every change and for the sake of the end exists potentiality therefore actuality is the end referring then to our previous example we could say that an actuality is when a plant does one of the activities that plants do for that for the sake of which a thing is is its principle and the becoming is for the sake of the end and the actuality is the end and it is for the sake of this that the potentiality is acquired for animals do not see in order that they may have sight but they have sight that they may see in summary the matter used to make a house has potentiality to be a house and both the activity of building and the form of the final house are actualities which is also a final cause or end then aristotle proceeds and concludes that the actuality is prior to potentiality in formula in time and in substantiality with this definition of the particular substance ie matter and form aristotle tries to solve the problem of the unity of the beings for example what is it that makes a man one since according to plato there are two ideas animal and biped how then is man a unity however according to aristotle the potential being matter and the actual one form are one and the same thing universals and particulars aristotles predecessor plato argued that all things have a universal form which could be either a property or a relation to other things when we look at an apple for example we see an apple and we can also analyze a form of an apple in this distinction there is a particular apple and a universal form of an apple moreover we can place an apple next to a book so that we can speak of both the book and apple as being next to each other plato argued that there are some universal forms that are not a part of particular things for example it is possible that there is no particular good in existence but good is still a proper universal form bertrand russell is a 20thcentury philosopher who agreed with plato on the existence of uninstantiated universals aristotle disagreed with plato on this point arguing that all universals are instantiated aristotle argued that there are no universals that are unattached to existing things according to aristotle if a universal exists either as a particular or a relation then there must have been must be currently or must be in the future something on which the universal can be predicated consequently according to aristotle if it is not the case that some universal can be predicated to an object that exists at some period of time then it does not exist in addition aristotle disagreed with plato about the location of universals as plato spoke of the world of the forms a location where all universal forms subsist aristotle maintained that universals exist within each thing on which each universal is predicated so according to aristotle the form of apple exists within each apple rather than in the world of the forms biology and medicine in aristotelian science especially in biology things he saw himself have stood the test of time better than his retelling of the reports of others which contain error and superstition he dissected animals but not humans his ideas on how the human body works have been almost entirely superseded empirical research program octopus swimming torpedo fuscomaculata leopard shark aristotle is the earliest natural historian whose work has survived in some detail aristotle certainly did research on the natural history of lesbos and the surrounding seas and neighbouring areas the works that reflect this research the history of animals generation of animals movement of animals and parts of animals contain some observations and interpretations along with sundry myths and mistakes the most striking passages are about the sealife visible from observation on lesbos and available from the catches of fishermen his observations on catfish electric fish torpedo and anglerfish are detailed as is his writing on cephalopods namely octopus sepia cuttlefish and the paper nautilus argonauta argo his description of the hectocotyl arm used in sexual reproduction was widely disbelieved until its rediscovery in the 19th century he separated the aquatic mammals from fish and knew that sharks and rays were part of the group he called selachē selachians an example of his methods including dissection and observation comes from the generation of animals where he describes breaking open fertilized chicken eggs at intervals to discover the sequence in which visible organs are generated aristotle gave accurate descriptions of the fourchambered forestomachs of ruminants and of the ovoviviparous embryological development of the hound shark mustelus mustelus classification of living things aristotle distinguished about 500 species of birds mammals and fishes what the modern zoologist would call vertebrates and invertebrates aristotle called animals with blood and animals without blood animals with blood were divided into livebearing mammals and eggbearing birds and fish invertebrates animals without blood are insects crustacea divided into nonshelled cephalopods and shelled and testacea molluscs aristotle believed that intellectual purposes ie final causes guided all natural processes such a teleological view gave aristotle cause to justify his observed data as an expression of formal design noting that no animal has at the same time both tusks and horns and a singlehooved animal with two horns i have never seen aristotle suggested that nature giving no animal both horns and tusks was staving off vanity and giving creatures faculties only to such a degree as they are necessary noting that ruminants had multiple stomachs and weak teeth he supposed the first was to compensate for the latter with nature trying to preserve a type of balance he stated in the history of animals that creatures were arranged in a graded scale of perfection rising from minerals to plants and animals and on up to man forming the scala naturae or great chain of being his system had eleven grades arranged according to the degree to which they are infected with potentiality expressed in their form at birth the highest animals laid warm and wet creatures alive the lowest bore theirs cold dry and in thick eggs for charles singer nothing is more remarkable than aristotles efforts to exhibit the relationships of living things as a scala naturae aristotle also held that the level of a creatures perfection was reflected in its form but not preordained by that form ideas like this and his ideas about souls are not regarded as science at all in modern times he placed emphasis on the types of soul an organism possessed asserting that plants possess a vegetative soul responsible for reproduction and growth animals a vegetative and a sensitive soul responsible for mobility and sensation and humans a vegetative a sensitive and a rational soul capable of thought and reflection aristotle in contrast to earlier philosophers but in accordance with the egyptians placed the rational soul in the heart rather than the brain notable is aristotles division of sensation and thought which generally went against previous philosophers with the exception of alcmaeon successor theophrastus frontispiece to a 1644 version of the expanded and illustrated edition of historia plantarum ca 1200 which was originally written around 300 bc aristotles successor at the lyceum theophrastus wrote a series of books on botany the history of plants which survived as the most important contribution of antiquity to botany even into the middle ages many of theophrastus names survive into modern times such as carpos for fruit and pericarpion for seed vessel rather than focus on formal causes as aristotle did theophrastus suggested a mechanistic scheme drawing analogies between natural and artificial processes and relying on aristotles concept of the efficient cause theophrastus also recognized the role of sex in the reproduction of some higher plants though this last discovery was lost in later ages influence on hellenistic medicine after theophrastus the lyceum failed to produce any original work though interest in aristotles ideas survived they were generally taken unquestioningly it is not until the age of alexandria under the ptolemies that advances in biology can be again found the first medical teacher at alexandria herophilus of chalcedon corrected aristotle placing intelligence in the brain and connected the nervous system to motion and sensation herophilus also distinguished between veins and arteries noting that the latter pulse while the former do not though a few ancient atomists such as lucretius challenged the teleological viewpoint of aristotelian ideas about life teleology and after the rise of christianity natural theology would remain central to biological thought essentially until the 18th and 19th centuries ernst mayr claimed that there was nothing of any real consequence in biology after lucretius and galen until the renaissance aristotles ideas of natural history and medicine survived but they were generally taken unquestioningly psychology aristotles psychology given in his treatise on the soul peri psyche often known by its latin title de anima posits three kinds of soul psyches the vegetative soul the sensitive soul and the rational soul humans have a rational soul this kind of soul is capable of the same powers as the other kinds like the vegetative soul it can grow and nourish itself like the sensitive soul it can experience sensations and move locally the unique part of the human rational soul is its ability to receive forms of other things and compare them for aristotle the soul psyche was a simpler concept than it is for us today by soul he simply meant the form of a living being because all beings are composites of form and matter the form of living beings is that which endows them with what is specific to living beings eg the ability to initiate movement or in the case of plants growth and chemical transformations which aristotle considers types of movement memory according to aristotle memory is the ability to hold a perceived experience in your mind and to have the ability to distinguish between the internal appearance and an occurrence in the past in other words a memory is a mental picture phantasm in which aristotle defines in de anima as an appearance which is imprinted on the part of the body that forms a memory aristotle believed an imprint becomes impressed on a semifluid bodily organ that undergoes several changes in order to make a memory a memory occurs when a stimuli is too complex that the nervous system semifluid bodily organ cannot receive all the impressions at once these changes are the same as those involved in the operations of sensation common sense and thinking the mental picture imprinted on the bodily organ is the final product of the entire process of sense perception it does not matter if the experience was seen or heard every experience ends up as a mental image in memory aristotle uses the word memory for two basic abilities first the actual retaining of the experience in the mnemonic imprint that can develop from sensation second the intellectual anxiety that comes with the imprint due to being impressed at a particular time and processing specific contents these abilities can be explained as memory is neither sensation nor thinking because is arises only after a lapse of time therefore memory is of the past prediction is of the future and sensation is of the present the retrieval of our imprints cannot be performed suddenly a transitional channel is needed and located in our past experiences both for our previous experience and present experience aristotle proposed that slowwitted people have good memory because the fluids in their brain do not wash away their memory organ used to imprint experiences and so the imprint can easily continue however they cannot be too slow or the hardened surface of the organ will not receive new imprints he believed the young and the old do not properly develop an imprint young people undergo rapid changes as they develop while the elderlys organs are beginning to decay thus stunting new imprints likewise people who are too quickwitted are similar to the young and the image cannot be fixed because of the rapid changes of their organ because intellectual functions are not involved in memory memories belong to some animals too but only those in which have perception of time recollection because aristotle believes people receive all kinds of sense perceptions and people perceive them as images or imprints people are continually weaving together new imprints of things they experience in order to search for these imprints people search the memory itself within the memory if one experience is offered instead of a specific memory that person will reject this experience until they find what they are looking for recollection occurs when one experience naturally follows another if the chain of images is needed one memory will stimulate the other if the chain of images is not needed but expected then it will only stimulate the other memory in most instances when people recall experiences they stimulate certain previous experiences until they have stimulated the one that was needed recollection is the selfdirected activity of retrieving the information stored in a memory imprint after some time has passed retrieval of stored information is dependent on the scope of mnemonic capabilities of a being human or animal and the abilities the human or animal possesses only humans will remember imprints of intellectual activity such as numbers and words animals that have perception of time will be able to retrieve memories of their past observations remembering involves only perception of the things remembered and of the time passed recollection of an imprint is when the present experiences a person remembers are similar with elements corresponding in character and arrangement of past sensory experiences when an imprint is recalled it may bring forth a large group of related imprints aristotle believed the chain of thought which ends in recollection of certain imprints was connected systematically in three sorts of relationships similarity contrast and contiguity these three laws make up his laws of association aristotle believed that past experiences are hidden within our mind a force operates to awaken the hidden material to bring up the actual experience according to aristotle association is the power innate in a mental state which operates upon the unexpressed remains of former experiences allowing them to rise and be recalled dreams sleep before understanding aristotles views on dreams first his idea of sleep must be examined aristotle gives an account of his explanation of sleep in on sleep and wakefulness sleep takes place as a result of overuse of the senses or of digestion so it is vital to the body including the senses so it can be revitalized while a person is asleep the critical activities which include thinking sensing recalling and remembering do not function as they do during wakefulness since a person cannot sense during sleep they can also not have a desire which is the result of a sensation however the senses are able to work during sleep albeit differently than when a person is awake because during sleep a person can still have sensory experiences also not all of the senses are inactive during sleep only the ones that are weary theory of dreams dreams do not involve actually sensing a stimulus because as discussed the senses do not work as they normally do during sleep in dreams sensation is still involved but in an altered manner than when awake aristotle explains the phenomenon that occurs when a person stares at a moving stimulus such as the waves in a body of water when they look away from that stimulus the next thing they look at appears to be moving in a wave like motion when a person perceives a stimulus and the stimulus is no longer the focus of their attention it leaves an impression when the body is awake and the senses are functioning properly a person constantly encounters new stimuli to sense and so the impressions left from previously perceived stimuli become irrelevant however during sleep the impressions stimuli made throughout the day become noticed because there are not new sensory experiences to distract from these impressions that were made so dreams result from these lasting impressions since impressions are all that are left and not the exact stimuli dreams will not resemble the actual experience that occurred when awake during sleep a person is in an altered state of mind aristotle compares a sleeping person to a person who is overtaken by strong feelings toward a stimulus for example a person who has a strong infatuation with someone may begin to think they see that person everywhere because they are so overtaken by their feelings when a person is asleep their senses are not acting as they do when they are awake and this results in them thinking like a person who is influenced by strong feelings since a person sleeping is in this suggestible state they become easily deceived by what appears in their dreams when asleep a person is unable to make judgments as they do when they are awake due to the senses not functioning normally during sleep they are unable to help a person judge what is happening in their dream this in turn leads the person to believe the dream is real dreams may be absurd in nature but the senses are not able to discern whether they are real or not so the dreamer is left to accept the dream because they lack the choice to judge it one component of aristotles theory of dreams introduces ideas that are contradictory to previously held beliefs he claimed that dreams are not foretelling and that they are not sent by a divine being aristotle reasoned that instances in which dreams do resemble future events are happenstances not divinations these ideas were contradictory to what had been believed about dreams but at the time in which he introduced these ideas more thinkers were beginning to give naturalistic as opposed to supernatural explanations to phenomena aristotle also includes in his theory of dreams what constitutes a dream and what does not he claimed that a dream is first established by the fact that the person is asleep when they experience it if a person had an image appear for a moment after waking up or if they see something in the dark it is not considered a dream because they were awake when it occurred secondly any sensory experience that actually occurs while a person is asleep and is perceived by the person while asleep does not qualify as part of a dream for example if while a person is sleeping a door shuts and in their dream they hear a door is shut aristotle argues that this sensory experience is not part of the dream the actual sensory experience is perceived by the senses the fact that it occurred while the person was asleep does not make it part of the dream lastly the images of dreams must be a result of lasting impressions of sensory experiences had when awake practical philosophy ethics aristotle considered ethics to be a practical rather than theoretical study ie one aimed at becoming good and doing good rather than knowing for its own sake he wrote several treatises on ethics including most notably the nicomachean ethics aristotle taught that virtue has to do with the proper function ergon of a thing an eye is only a good eye in so much as it can see because the proper function of an eye is sight aristotle reasoned that humans must have a function specific to humans and that this function must be an activity of the psuchē normally translated as soul in accordance with reason logos aristotle identified such an optimum activity of the soul as the aim of all human deliberate action eudaimonia generally translated as happiness or sometimes well being to have the potential of ever being happy in this way necessarily requires a good character ēthikē aretē often translated as moral or ethical virtue or excellence aristotle taught that to achieve a virtuous and potentially happy character requires a first stage of having the fortune to be habituated not deliberately but by teachers and experience leading to a later stage in which one consciously chooses to do the best things when the best people come to live life this way their practical wisdom phronesis and their intellect nous can develop with each other towards the highest possible human virtue the wisdom of an accomplished theoretical or speculative thinker or in other words a philosopher politics aristotles classification of constitutions in addition to his works on ethics which address the individual aristotle addressed the city in his work titled politics aristotle considered the city to be a natural community moreover he considered the city to be prior in importance to the family which in turn is prior to the individual for the whole must of necessity be prior to the part he also famously stated that man is by nature a political animal and also arguing that humanitys defining factor among others in the animal kingdom is its rationality aristotle conceived of politics as being like an organism rather than like a machine and as a collection of parts none of which can exist without the others aristotles conception of the city is organic and he is considered one of the first to conceive of the city in this manner the common modern understanding of a political community as a modern state is quite different from aristotles understanding although he was aware of the existence and potential of larger empires the natural community according to aristotle was the city polis which functions as a political community or partnership koinōnia the aim of the city is not just to avoid injustice or for economic stability but rather to allow at least some citizens the possibility to live a good life and to perform beautiful acts the political partnership must be regarded therefore as being for the sake of noble actions not for the sake of living together this is distinguished from modern approaches beginning with social contract theory according to which individuals leave the state of nature because of fear of violent death or its inconveniences excerpt from a speech by the character aristotle in the book protrepticus hutchinson and johnson 2015 p 22 for we all agree that the most excellent man should rule ie the supreme by nature and that the law rules and alone is authoritative but the law is a kind of intelligence ie a discourse based on intelligence and again what standard do we have what criterion of good things that is more precise than the intelligent man for all that this man will choose if the choice is based on his knowledge are good things and their contraries are bad and since everybody chooses most of all what conforms to their own proper dispositions a just man choosing to live justly a man with bravery to live bravely likewise a selfcontrolled man to live with selfcontrol it is clear that the intelligent man will choose most of all to be intelligent for this is the function of that capacity hence its evident that according to the most authoritative judgment intelligence is supreme among goods rhetoric and poetics aristotle considered epic poetry tragedy comedy dithyrambic poetry and music to be imitative each varying in imitation by medium object and manner for example music imitates with the media of rhythm and harmony whereas dance imitates with rhythm alone and poetry with language the forms also differ in their object of imitation comedy for instance is a dramatic imitation of men worse than average whereas tragedy imitates men slightly better than average lastly the forms differ in their manner of imitation through narrative or character through change or no change and through drama or no drama aristotle believed that imitation is natural to mankind and constitutes one of mankinds advantages over animals while it is believed that aristotles poetics comprised two books one on comedy and one on tragedy only the portion that focuses on tragedy has survived aristotle taught that tragedy is composed of six elements plotstructure character style thought spectacle and lyric poetry the characters in a tragedy are merely a means of driving the story and the plot not the characters is the chief focus of tragedy tragedy is the imitation of action arousing pity and fear and is meant to effect the catharsis of those same emotions aristotle concludes poetics with a discussion on which if either is superior epic or tragic mimesis he suggests that because tragedy possesses all the attributes of an epic possibly possesses additional attributes such as spectacle and music is more unified and achieves the aim of its mimesis in shorter scope it can be considered superior to epic aristotle was a keen systematic collector of riddles folklore and proverbs he and his school had a special interest in the riddles of the delphic oracle and studied the fables of aesop views on women aristotles analysis of procreation describes an active ensouling masculine element bringing life to an inert passive female element on this ground feminist metaphysics have accused aristotle of misogyny and sexism however aristotle gave equal weight to womens happiness as he did to mens and commented in his rhetoric that the things that lead to happiness need to be in women as well as men

7,aristotle by jusepe de ribera aristotle with a bust of homer by rembrandt a thirteenthcentury islamic portrayal of aristotle statue by cipri adolf bermann 1915 at the university of freiburg more than 2300 years after his death aristotle remains one of the most influential people who ever lived he contributed to almost every field of human knowledge then in existence and he was the founder of many new fields according to the philosopher bryan magee it is doubtful whether any human being has ever known as much as he did among countless other achievements aristotle was the founder of formal logic pioneered the study of zoology and left every future scientist and philosopher in his debt through his contributions to the scientific method despite these achievements the influence of aristotles errors is considered by some to have held back science considerably bertrand russell notes that almost every serious intellectual advance has had to begin with an attack on some aristotelian doctrine russell also refers to aristotles ethics as repulsive and calls his logic as definitely antiquated as ptolemaic astronomy russell notes that these errors make it difficult to do historical justice to aristotle until one remembers how large of an advance he made upon all of his predecessors later greek philosophers the immediate influence of aristotles work was felt as the lyceum grew into the peripatetic school aristotles notable students included aristoxenus dicaearchus demetrius of phalerum eudemos of rhodes harpalus hephaestion mnason of phocis nicomachus and theophrastus aristotles influence over alexander the great is seen in the latters bringing with him on his expedition a host of zoologists botanists and researchers he had also learned a great deal about persian customs and traditions from his teacher although his respect for aristotle was diminished as his travels made it clear that much of aristotles geography was clearly wrong when the old philosopher released his works to the public alexander complained thou hast not done well to publish thy acroamatic doctrines for in what shall i surpass other men if those doctrines wherein i have been trained are to be all mens common property influence on byzantine scholars greek christian scribes played a crucial role in the preservation of aristotle by copying all the extant greek language manuscripts of the corpus the first greek christians to comment extensively on aristotle were john philoponus elias and david in the sixth century and stephen of alexandria in the early seventh century john philoponus stands out for having attempted a fundamental critique of aristotles views on the eternity of the world movement and other elements of aristotelian thought after a hiatus of several centuries formal commentary by eustratius and michael of ephesus reappears in the late eleventh and early twelfth centuries apparently sponsored by anna comnena influence on islamic theologians aristotle was one of the most revered western thinkers in early islamic theology most of the still extant works of aristotle as well as a number of the original greek commentaries were translated into arabic and studied by muslim philosophers scientists and scholars averroes avicenna and alpharabius who wrote on aristotle in great depth also influenced thomas aquinas and other western christian scholastic philosophers alkindus considered aristotle as the outstanding and unique representative of philosophy and averroes spoke of aristotle as the exemplar for all future philosophers medieval muslim scholars regularly described aristotle as the first teacher the title teacher was first given to aristotle by muslim scholars and was later used by western philosophers as in the famous poem of dante who were influenced by the tradition of islamic philosophy in accordance with the greek theorists the muslims considered aristotle to be a dogmatic philosopher the author of a closed system and believed that aristotle shared with plato essential tenets of thought some went so far as to credit aristotle himself with neoplatonic metaphysical ideas influence on western christian theologians with the loss of the study of ancient greek in the early medieval latin west aristotle was practically unknown there from c ad 600 to c 1100 except through the latin translation of the organon made by boethius in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries interest in aristotle revived and latin christians had translations made both from arabic translations such as those by gerard of cremona and from the original greek such as those by james of venice and william of moerbeke after thomas aquinas wrote his theology working from moerbekes translations the demand for aristotles writings grew and the greek manuscripts returned to the west stimulating a revival of aristotelianism in europe that continued into the renaissance aristotle is referred to as the philosopher by scholastic thinkers such as thomas aquinas see summa theologica part i question 3 etc these thinkers blended aristotelian philosophy with christianity bringing the thought of ancient greece into the middle ages it required a repudiation of some aristotelian principles for the sciences and the arts to free themselves for the discovery of modern scientific laws and empirical methods the medieval english poet chaucer describes his student as being happy by having at his beddes heed twenty bookes clad in blak or reed of aristotle and his philosophie the italian poet dante says of aristotle in the first circles of hell vidi l maestro di color che sanno seder tra filosofica famiglia tutti lo miran tutti onor li fanno quivi vidïo socrate e platone che nnanzi a li altri più presso li stanno i saw the master there of those who know amid the philosophic family by all admired and by all reverenced there plato too i saw and socrates who stood beside him closer than the rest dante linferno hell canto iv lines 131135 postenlightenment thinkers the german philosopher friedrich nietzsche has been said to have taken nearly all of his political philosophy from aristotle however debatable this is aristotle rigidly separated action from production and argued for the deserved subservience of some people natural slaves and the natural superiority virtue arete of others it is martin heidegger not nietzsche who elaborated a new interpretation of aristotle intended to warrant his deconstruction of scholastic and philosophical tradition ayn rand accredited aristotle as the greatest philosopher in history and cited him as a major influence on her thinking more recently alasdair macintyre has attempted to reform what he calls the aristotelian tradition in a way that is antielitist and capable of disputing the claims of both liberals and nietzscheans

7,first page of a 1566 edition of the nicomachean ethics in greek and latin aristotle wrote his works on papyrus scrolls or rolls which was the common writing medium of that era modern scholarship reveals that aristotles lost works stray considerably in characterization from the surviving aristotelian corpus whereas the lost works appear to have been originally written with an intent for subsequent publication the surviving works do not appear to have been so rather the surviving works mostly resemble lecture notes unintended for publication the authenticity of a portion of the surviving works as originally aristotelian is also today held suspect with some books duplicating or summarizing each other the authorship of one book questioned and another book considered to be unlikely aristotles at all some of the individual works within the corpus including the constitution of athens are regarded by most scholars as products of aristotles school perhaps compiled under his direction or supervision others such as on colors may have been produced by aristotles successors at the lyceum eg theophrastus and straton still others acquired aristotles name through similarities in doctrine or content such as the de plantis possibly by nicolaus of damascus other works in the corpus include medieval palmistries and astrological and magical texts whose connections to aristotle are purely fanciful and selfpromotional according to a distinction that originates with aristotle himself his writings are divisible into two groups the exoteric and the esoteric most scholars have understood this as a distinction between works aristotle intended for the public exoteric and the more technical works intended for use within the lyceum course school esoteric modern scholars commonly assume these latter to be aristotles own unpolished lecture notes or in some cases possible notes by his students however one classic scholar offers an alternative interpretation the 5th century neoplatonist ammonius hermiae writes that aristotles writing style is deliberately obscurantist so that good people may for that reason stretch their mind even more whereas empty minds that are lost through carelessness will be put to flight by the obscurity when they encounter sentences like these another common assumption is that none of the exoteric works is extant that all of aristotles extant writings are of the esoteric kind current knowledge of what exactly the exoteric writings were like is scant and dubious though many of them may have been in dialogue form fragments of some of aristotles dialogues have survived perhaps it is to these that cicero refers when he characterized aristotles writing style as a river of gold it is hard for many modern readers to accept that one could seriously so admire the style of those works currently available to us however some modern scholars have warned that we cannot know for certain that ciceros praise was reserved specifically for the exoteric works a few modern scholars have actually admired the concise writing style found in aristotles extant works one major question in the history of aristotles works then is how were the exoteric writings all lost and how did the ones we now possess come to us the story of the original manuscripts of the esoteric treatises is described by strabo in his geography and plutarch in his parallel lives the manuscripts were left from aristotle to his successor theophrastus who in turn willed them to neleus of scepsis neleus supposedly took the writings from athens to scepsis where his heirs let them languish in a cellar until the 1st century bc when apellicon of teos discovered and purchased the manuscripts bringing them back to athens according to the story apellicon tried to repair some of the damage that was done during the manuscripts stay in the basement introducing a number of errors into the text when lucius cornelius sulla occupied athens in 86 bc he carried off the library of apellicon to rome where they were first published in 60 bc by the grammarian tyrannion of amisus and then by the philosopher andronicus of rhodes carnes lord attributes the popular belief in this story to the fact that it provides the most plausible explanation for the rapid eclipse of the peripatetic school after the middle of the third century and for the absence of widespread knowledge of the specialized treatises of aristotle throughout the hellenistic period as well as for the sudden reappearance of a flourishing aristotelianism during the first century bc lord voices a number of reservations concerning this story however first the condition of the texts is far too good for them to have suffered considerable damage followed by apellicons inexpert attempt at repair second there is incontrovertible evidence lord says that the treatises were in circulation during the time in which strabo and plutarch suggest they were confined within the cellar in scepsis third the definitive edition of aristotles texts seems to have been made in athens some fifty years before andronicus supposedly compiled his and fourth ancient library catalogues predating andronicus intervention list an aristotelian corpus quite similar to the one we currently possess lord sees a number of postaristotelian interpolations in the politics for example but is generally confident that the work has come down to us relatively intact on the one hand the surviving texts of aristotle do not derive from finished literary texts but rather from working drafts used within aristotles school as opposed on the other hand to the dialogues and other exoteric texts which aristotle published more widely during his lifetime the consensus is that andronicus of rhodes collected the esoteric works of aristotles school which existed in the form of smaller separate works distinguished them from those of theophrastus and other peripatetics edited them and finally compiled them into the more cohesive larger works as they are known today

8,gershwin was attracted by maurice ravels unusual chords after transatlantic letters back and forth as to whether ravel took students and how much he charged ravel looked at gershwins prior year earnings and sent a telegram to gershwin jokingly saying he ravel should study with gershwin but ravel accepted him as a student and gershwin went on his first trip to paris in 1926 ready to study after his initial student audition with ravel turned into a sharing of musical theories ravel said he couldnt teach him but he would send a letter referring him to nadia boulanger while the studies were cut short that 1926 trip resulted in the initial version of an american in paris written as a thank you note to gershwins hosts robert and mabel shirmer gershwin called it a rhapsodic ballet it is written freely and in a much more modern idiom than his prior works gershwin strongly encouraged ravel to come to the united states for a tour something ravel had been reluctant to do to this end upon his return to new york gershwin joined the efforts of ravels friend robert schmitz a pianist ravel had met during the war to urge ravel to tour the us schmitz was the head of pro musica promoting francoamerican musical relations and was able to offer ravel a 12000 fee for the tour an enticement gershwin knew would be important to ravel gershwin greeted ravel in new york in february 1928 at the start of ravels us tour and joined ravel again later in the tour in los angeles after a lunch together with chaplin in beverly hills ravel was persuaded to perform an unscheduled house concert in a friends music salon performing among kindred spirits ravels tour reignited gershwins desire to return to paris which he did in march 1928 ravels high praise of gershwin in an introductory letter to boulanger caused gershwin to seriously consider taking much more time to study abroad in paris yet after playing for her she told him she could not teach him nadia boulanger gave gershwin basically the same advice she gave all of her accomplished master students dont copy others be yourself in this case why try to be a second rate ravel when you are already a first rate gershwin this did not set gershwin back as his real intent abroad was to complete a new work based on paris and perhaps a second rhapsody for piano and orchestra to follow his rhapsody in blue paris at this time hosted many expatriate writers among them ezra pound w b yeats ernest hemingway and artist pablo picasso

8,gershwin did not particularly like walter damroschs interpretation at the world premiere of an american in paris he stated that damroschs sluggish dragging tempo caused him to walk out of the hall during a matinee performance of this work the audience according to edward cushing responded with a demonstration of enthusiasm impressively genuine in contrast to the conventional applause which new music good and bad ordinarily arouses critics believed that an american in paris was better crafted than his lukewarm concerto in f some did not think it belonged in a program with classical composers césar franck richard wagner or guillaume lekeu on its premiere gershwin responded to the critics its not a beethoven symphony you know its a humorous piece nothing solemn about it its not intended to draw tears if it pleases symphony audiences as a light jolly piece a series of impressions musically expressed it succeeds

as the oscar statuette made of goldplated britannium on a black metal base it is 135 in 343 cm tall the award weighs 85 lb 3856 kg and depicts a knight rendered in art deco style holding a crusaders sword standing on a reel of film with five spokes the five spokes represent the original branches of the academy actors writers directors producers and technicians the model for the statuette is said to be mexican actor emilio el indio fernández sculptor george stanley who also did the muse fountain at the hollywood bowl sculpted cedric gibbons design the statuettes presented at the initial ceremonies were goldplated solid bronze within a few years the bronze was abandoned in favor of britannia metal a pewterlike alloy which is then plated in copper nickel silver and finally 24karat gold due to a metal shortage during world war ii oscars were made of painted plaster for three years following the war the academy invited recipients to redeem the plaster figures for goldplated metal ones the only addition to the oscar since it was created is a minor streamlining of the base the original oscar mold was cast in 1928 at the cw shumway sons foundry in batavia illinois which also contributed to casting the molds for the vince lombardi trophy and emmy awards statuettes from 1983 to 2015 approximately 50 oscars were made each year in chicago by illinois manufacturer rs owens company it takes between three and four weeks to manufacture 50 statuettes in 2016 the academy returned to bronze as the core metal of the statuettes handing manufacturing duties to rock tavern new yorkbased polich tallix fine art foundry while based on a digital scan of an original 1929 oscar the new statuettes will retain their modernera dimensions and black pedestal cast in liquid bronze from 3dprinted ceramic molds and polished they are then electroplated in 24karat gold by brooklyn new yorkbased epner technology the time required to produce 50 such statuettes is roughly 3 months rs owens is expected to continue producing other awards for the academy and service existing oscars naming the origin of the name oscar is disputed one biography of bette davis who was a president of the academy claims that she named the oscar after her first husband band leader harmon oscar nelson another claimed origin is that the academys executive secretary margaret herrick first saw the award in 1931 and made reference to the statuettes reminding her of her uncle oscar a nickname for her cousin oscar pierce columnist sidney skolsky was present during herricks naming and seized the name in his byline employees have affectionately dubbed their famous statuette oscar one of the earliest mentions of the term oscar dates back to a time magazine article about the 1934 6th academy awards walt disney is also quoted as thanking the academy for his oscar as early as 1932 the trophy was officially dubbed the oscar in 1939 by the academy of motion picture arts and sciences engraving to prevent information identifying the oscar winners from leaking ahead of the ceremony oscar statuettes presented at the ceremony have blank baseplates until 2010 winners were expected to return the statuettes to the academy after the ceremony and wait several weeks to have inscriptions applied since 2010 winners have had the option of having engraved nameplates applied to their statuettes at an inscriptionprocessing station at the governors ball a party held immediately after the oscar ceremony in 2010 the rs owens company made 197 engraved nameplates ahead of the ceremony bearing the names of every potential winner the 175 or so nameplates for nonwinning nominees were recycled afterwards ownership of oscar statuettes since 1950 the statuettes have been legally encumbered by the requirement that neither winners nor their heirs may sell the statuettes without first offering to sell them back to the academy for us1 if a winner refuses to agree to this stipulation then the academy keeps the statuette academy awards not protected by this agreement have been sold in public auctions and private deals for sixfigure sums in december 2011 orson welles 1941 oscar for citizen kane best original screenplay was put up for auction after his heirs won a 2004 court decision contending that welles did not sign any agreement to return the statue to the academy on december 20 2011 it sold in an online auction for us861542 in 1992 harold russell needed money for his wifes medical expenses in a controversial decision he consigned his 1946 oscar for best supporting actor for the best years of our lives to herman darvick autograph auctions and on august 6 1992 in new york city the oscar sold to a private collector for 60500 since he won the award before 1950 he was not required to offer it to the academy first russell defended his decision saying i dont know why anybody would be critical my wifes health is much more important than sentimental reasons the movie will be here even if oscar isnt harold russell is the only academy awardwinning actor to ever sell an oscar while the oscar is owned by the recipient it is essentially not on the open market michael todds grandson tried to sell todds oscar statuette to a movie prop collector in 1989 but the academy won the legal battle by getting a permanent injunction although some oscar sales transactions have been

10,the academy awards now known officially as the oscars is a set of twentyfour awards for artistic and technical merit in the american film industry given annually by the academy of motion picture arts and sciences ampas to recognize excellence in cinematic achievements as assessed by the academys voting membership the various category winners are awarded a copy of a golden statuette officially called the academy award of merit which has become commonly known by its nickname oscar the awards first presented in 1929 at the hollywood roosevelt hotel are overseen by ampas the awards ceremony was first broadcast on radio in 1930 and televised for the first time in 1953 it is now seen live in more than 200 countries and can be streamed live online the academy awards ceremony is the oldest worldwide entertainment awards ceremony its equivalents the emmy awards for television the tony awards for theater and the grammy awards for music and recording are modeled after the academy awards the 89th academy awards ceremony honoring the best films of 2016 were held on february 26 2017 at the dolby theatre in los angeles california the ceremony was hosted by jimmy kimmel and was broadcast on abc a total of 3048 oscars have been awarded from the inception of the award through the 89th

10,telecast pantages theatre hollywood 1959 81st academy awards presentations dolby theatre hollywood 2009 the major awards are presented at a live televised ceremony most commonly in late february or early march following the relevant calendar year and six weeks after the announcement of the nominees it is the culmination of the film awards season which usually begins during november or december of the previous year this is an elaborate extravaganza with the invited guests walking up the red carpet in the creations of the most prominent fashion designers of the day black tie dress is the most common outfit for men although fashion may dictate not wearing a bowtie and musical performers sometimes do not adhere to this the artists who recorded the nominees for best original song quite often perform those songs live at the awards ceremony and the fact that they are performing is often used to promote the television broadcast the academy awards is the only awards show that is televised live in all united states time zones excluding hawaii they aired live in alaska starting in 2011 for the first time since 1996 canada the united kingdom and gathers millions of viewers elsewhere throughout the worldthe oscars were first televised in 1953 by nbc which continued to broadcast the event until 1960 when abc took over televising the festivities including the first color broadcast of the event in 1966 through 1970 after which nbc resumed the broadcasts abc once again took over broadcast duties in 1976 and has broadcast the oscars ever since its current contract with the academy runs through 2028 the academy has also produced condensed versions of the ceremony for broadcast in international markets especially those outside of the americas in more desirable local timeslots the ceremony was broadcast live internationally for the first time via satellite in 1970 but only two south american countries chile and brazil purchased the rights to air the broadcast by that time the television rights to the academy awards had been sold in 50 countries a decade later the rights were already being sold to 60 countries and by 1984 the tv rights to the awards were licensed in 76 countries the ceremonies were moved up from late march or early april to late february or early march starting in 2004 to help disrupt and shorten the intense lobbying and ad campaigns associated with oscar season in the film industry another reason was because of the growing tv ratings success of the ncaa division i mens basketball tournament which would cut into the academy awards audience the earlier date is also to the advantage of abc as it now usually occurs during the highly profitable and important february sweeps period some years the ceremony is moved into early march in deference to the winter olympics another reason for the move to late february and early march is to avoid the awards ceremony occurring so close to the religious holidays of passover and easter which for decades had been a grievance from members and the general public advertising is somewhat restricted however as traditionally no movie studios or competitors of official academy award sponsors may advertise during the telecast the awards show holds the distinction of having won the most emmys in history with 47 wins and 195 nominations after many years of being held on mondays at 900 pm eastern600 pm pacific in 1999 the ceremonies were moved to sundays at 830 pm eastern530 pm pacific the reasons given for the move were that more viewers would tune in on sundays that los angeles rushhour traffic jams could be avoided and that an earlier start time would allow viewers on the east coast to go to bed earlier for many years the film industry had opposed a sunday broadcast because it would cut into the weekend box office the academy has contemplated moving the ceremony even further back into january citing tv viewers fatigue with the film industrys long awards season however such an accelerated schedule would dramatically decrease the voting period for its members to the point where some voters would only have time to view the contending films streamed on their computers as opposed to traditionally receiving the films and ballots in the mail also a january or earlyfebruary ceremony held on a sunday would have to compete with national football league playoff games such as the super bowl originally scheduled for april 8 1968 the 40th academy awards ceremony was postponed for two days because of the assassination of dr martin luther king jr on march 30 1981 the 53rd academy awards was postponed for one day after the shooting of president ronald reagan and others in washington dc in 1993 an in memoriam segment was introduced honoring those who had made a significant contribution to cinema who had died in the preceding 12 months a selection compiled by a small committee of academy members this segment has drawn criticism over the years for the omission of some names criticism was also levied for many years regarding another aspect with the segment having a popularity contest feel as the audience varied their applause to those who had died by the subjects cultural impact the applause has since been muted during the telecast and the audience is discouraged from clapping during the segment and giving silent reflection instead in terms of broadcast length the ceremony generally averages three and a half hours the first oscars in 1929 lasted 15 minutes at the other end of the spectrum the 2002 ceremony lasted four hours and twentythree minutes in 2010 the organizers of the academy awards announced that winners acceptance speeches must not run past 45 seconds this according to organizer bill mechanic was to ensure the elimination of what he termed the single most hated thing on the show overly long and embarrassing displays of emotion in 2016 in a further effort to streamline speeches winners dedications were displayed on an onscreen ticker although still dominant in ratings the viewership of the academy awards have steadily dropped the 88th academy awards were the lowestrated in the past eight years although with increases in male and 1849 viewership while the show itself also faced mixed reception following the show variety reported that abc was in negotiating an extension to its contract to broadcast the oscars seeking to have more creative control over the broadcast itself currently and nominally ampas is responsible for most aspects of the telecast including the choice of production staff and hosting although abc is allowed to have some input on their decisions in august 2016 ampas extended its contract with abc through 2028 the contract does not contain any notable changes nor gives abc any further creative control over the telecast tv ratings historically the oscarcast has pulled in a bigger haul when boxoffice hits are favored to win the best picture trophy more than 5725 million viewers tuned to the telecast for the 70th academy awards in 1998 the year of titanic which generated close to us600 million at the north american box office preoscars the 76th academy awards ceremony in which the lord of the rings the return of the king pretelecast box office earnings of us368 million received 11 awards including best picture drew 4356 million viewers the most watched ceremony based on nielsen ratings to date however was the 42nd academy awards best picture midnight cowboy which drew a 434 household rating on 7 april 1970 by contrast ceremonies honoring films that have not performed well at the box office tend to show weaker ratings the 78th academy awards which awarded lowbudgeted independent film crash with a preoscar gross of us534 million generated an audience of 3864 million with a household rating of 2291 in 2008 the 80th academy awards telecast was watched by 3176 million viewers on average with an 1866 household rating the lowest rated and least watched ceremony to date in spite of celebrating 80 years of the academy awards the best picture winner of that particular ceremony was another independently financed film no country for old men

10,since 2004 academy award nomination results have been announced to the public in late january prior to that the results were announced in early february voters the academy of motion picture arts and sciences ampas a professional honorary organization maintains a voting membership of 5783 academy membership is divided into different branches with each representing a different discipline in film production actors constitute the largest voting bloc numbering 1311 members 22 percent of the academys composition votes have been certified by the auditing firm pricewaterhousecoopers and its predecessor price waterhouse for the past 83 annual awards ceremonies all ampas members must be invited to join by the board of governors on behalf of academy branch executive committees membership eligibility may be achieved by a competitive nomination or a member may submit a name based on other significant contributions to the field of motion pictures new membership proposals are considered annually the academy does not publicly disclose its membership although as recently as 2007 press releases have announced the names of those who have been invited to join the 2007 release also stated that it has just under 6000 voting members while the membership had been growing stricter policies have kept its size steady since then in 2012 the results of a study conducted by the los angeles times were published describing the demographic breakdown of approximately 88 of ampas voting membership of the 5100 active voters confirmed 94 were caucasian 77 were male and 54 were found to be over the age of 60 33 of voting members are former nominees 14 and winners 19 in may 2011 the academy sent a letter advising its 6000 or so voting members that an online system for oscar voting would be implemented in 2013 rules according to rules 2 and 3 of the official academy awards rules a film must open in the previous calendar year from midnight at the start of january 1 to midnight at the end of december 31 in los angeles county california and play for seven consecutive days to qualify except for the best foreign language film best documentary feature and best documentary short subject the best foreign language film award does not require a us release the best documentary feature award requires weeklong releases in both los angeles county and new york city during the previous calendar year the best documentary short subject award has noticeably different eligibility rules from most other competitive awards first the qualifying period for release does not coincide with a calendar year instead covering a oneyear period starting on september 1 and ending on the august 31 of the calendar year before the ceremony second there are multiple methods of qualification the main method is a weeklong theatrical release in either los angeles county or new york city during the eligibility period films also can qualify by winning specified awards at one of a number of competitive film festivals designated by the academy finally a film that is selected as a gold silver or bronze medal winner in the documentary category of the immediately previous student academy awards is also eligible for example the 2009 best picture winner the hurt locker was actually first released in 2008 but did not qualify for the 2008 awards as it did not play its oscarqualifying run in los angeles until mid2009 thus qualifying for the 2009 awards foreign films must include english subtitles and each country can submit only one film per year rule 2 states that a film must be featurelength defined as a minimum of 40 minutes except for shortsubject awards and it must exist either on a 35 mm or 70 mm film print or in 24 frames or 48 frames progressive scan digital cinema format with a minimum projector resolution of 2048 by 1080 pixels effective with the 90th academy awards to be presented in 2018 multipart and limited series will be ineligible for the best documentary feature award this followed the win of oj made in america an eighthour presentation that was screened in a limited release before being broadcast in five parts on abc and espn in that category in 2017 the academys announcement of the new rule made no direct mention of that film producers must submit an official screen credits online form before the deadline in case it is not submitted by the defined deadline the film will be ineligible for academy awards in any year the form includes the production credits for all related categories then each form is checked and put in a reminder list of eligible releases in late december ballots and copies of the reminder list of eligible releases are mailed to around 6000 active members for most categories members from each of the branches vote to determine the nominees only in their respective categories ie only directors vote for directors writers for writers actors for actors etc in the special case of best picture all voting members are eligible to select the nominees in all major categories a variant of the single transferable vote is used with each member casting a ballot with up to five nominees ten for best picture ranked preferentially in certain categories including foreign film documentary and animated feature film nominees are selected by special screening committees made up of members from all branches in most categories the winner is selected from among the nominees by plurality voting of all members since 2009 the best picture winner has been chosen by instant runoff voting since 2013 reweighted range voting has been used to select the nominees for the best visual effects film companies will spend as much as several million dollars on marketing to awards voters for a movie in the running for best picture in attempts to improve chances of receiving oscars and other movie awards conferred in oscar season the academy enforces rules to limit overt campaigning by its members so as to try to eliminate excesses and prevent the process from becoming undignified it has an awards czar on staff who advises members on allowed practices and levies penalties on offenders for example a producer of the 2009 best picture nominee the hurt locker was disqualified as a producer in the category when he contacted associates urging them to vote for his film and not another that was seen as the frontrunner the hurt locker eventually won
10,accusations of commercialism due to the positive exposure and prestige of the academy awards studios spend millions of dollars and hire publicists specifically to promote their films during what is typically called the oscar season this has generated accusations of the academy awards being influenced more by marketing than quality william friedkin an academy awardwinning film director and former producer of the ceremony expressed this sentiment at a conference in new york in 2009 describing it as the greatest promotion scheme that any industry ever devised for itself tim dirks editor of amcs filmsiteorg has written of the academy awards accusations of bias typical criticism of the academy awards for best picture is that among the winners and nominees there is an overrepresentation of romantic historical epics biographical dramas romantic dramedies and family melodramas most of which are released in the us the last three months of the calendar year the oscars have been infamously known for selecting specific genres of movies to be awarded this has led to the coining of the term oscar bait describing such movies this has led at times to more specific criticisms that the academy is disconnected from the audience eg by favoring oscar bait over audience favorites or favoring historical melodramas over critically acclaimed movies that depict current life issues allegations of a lack of diversity the academic awards have long received criticism over its lack of diversity among the nominees the 88th awards ceremony became the target of a boycott based on critics perception that its allwhite acting nominee list reflected bias in response the academy initiated historic changes in membership by the year 2020 symbolism or sentimentalization acting prizes in certain years have been criticized for not recognizing superior performances so much as being awarded for personal popularity or presented as a career honor to recognize a distinguished nominees entire body of work refusing the award some winners critical of the academy awards have boycotted the ceremonies and refused to accept their oscars the first to do so was dudley nichols best writing in 1935 for the informer nichols boycotted the 8th academy awards ceremony because of conflicts between the academy and the writers guild george c scott became the second person to refuse his award best actor in 1970 for patton at the 43rd academy awards ceremony scott described it as a meat parade saying i dont want any part of it the third was marlon brando who refused his award best actor for 1972s the godfather citing the film industrys discrimination and mistreatment of native americans at the 45th academy awards ceremony brando sent sacheen littlefeather to read a 15page speech detailing his criticisms

13,early atomic time scales consisted of quartz clocks with frequencies calibrated by a single atomic clock the atomic clocks were not operated continuously atomic timekeeping services started experimentally in 1955 using the first caesium atomic clock at the national physical laboratory uk npl the greenwich atomic ga scale began in 1955 at the royal greenwich observatory the international time bureau bih began a time scale tm or am in july 1955 using both local caesium clocks and comparisons to distant clocks using the phase of vlf radio signals the united states naval observatory began the a1 scale 13 september 1956 using an atomichron commercial atomic clock followed by the nbsa scale at the national bureau of standards boulder colorado both the bih scale and a1 were defined by an epoch at the beginning of 1958 it was set to read julian date 24362045 1 january 1958 000000 at the corresponding ut2 instant the procedures used by the bih evolved and the name for the time scale changed a3 in 1963 and tabih in 1969 this synchronisation was inevitably imperfect depending as it did on the astronomical realisation of ut2 at the time ut2 as published by various observatories differed by several hundredths of a second the si second was defined in terms of the caesium atom in 1967 and in 1971 the name international atomic time tai was assigned to a time scale based on si seconds with no leap seconds during this time irregularities in the atomic time were detected and corrected in 1967 it was suggested that nearby masses caused clocks to operate at different rates but this was disproven in 1968 in the 1970s it became clear that the clocks participating in tai were ticking at different rates due to gravitational time dilation and the combined tai scale therefore corresponded to an average of the altitudes of the various clocks starting from julian date 24431445 1 january 1977 000000 corrections were applied to the output of all participating clocks so that tai would correspond to proper time at mean sea level the geoid because the clocks had been on average well above sea level this meant that tai slowed down by about one part in a trillion the former uncorrected time scale continues to be published under the name eal echelle atomique libre meaning free atomic scale the instant that the gravitational correction started to be applied serves as the epoch for barycentric coordinate time tcb geocentric coordinate time tcg and terrestrial time tt which represent three fundamental time scales in the solar system all three of these time scales were defined to read jd 24431445003725 1 january 1977 000032184 exactly at that instant the offset is to provide continuity with the older ephemeris time tai was henceforth a realisation of tt with the equation tttai tai 32184 s the continued existence of tai was questioned in a 2007 letter from the bipm to the itur which stated in the case of a redefinition of utc without leap seconds the cctf would consider discussing the possibility of suppressing tai as it would remain parallel to the continuous utc utc is a discontinuous ie regularly adjusted by leap seconds time scale composed from segments that are linear transformations of atomic time from its beginning in 1961 through december 1971 the adjustments were made regularly in fractional leap seconds so that utc approximated ut2 afterwards these adjustments were made only in whole seconds to approximate ut1 this was a compromise arrangement in order to enable a publicly broadcast time scale the post1971 more linear transformation of the bihs atomic time meant that the time scale would be more stable and easier to synchronize internationally the fact that it continues to approximate ut1 means that tasks such as navigation which require a source of universal time continue to be well served by the public broadcast of utc

14,there exists a wide range of philosophical views on humans obligations or motivations to act altruistically proponents of ethical altruism maintain that individuals are morally obligated to act altruistically the opposing view is ethical egoism which maintains that moral agents should always act in their own selfinterest both ethical altruism and ethical egoism contrast with utilitarianism which maintains that each agent should act in order to maximise the efficacy of their function and the benefit to both themselves and their coinhabitants a related concept in descriptive ethics is psychological egoism the thesis that humans always act in their own selfinterest and that true altruism is impossible rational egoism is the view that rationality consists in acting in ones selfinterest without specifying how this affects ones moral obligations
14,the concept has a long history in philosophical and ethical thought the term was originally coined in the 19th century by the founding sociologist and philosopher of science auguste comte and has become a major topic for psychologists especially evolutionary psychology researchers evolutionary biologists and ethologists whilst ideas about altruism from one field can affect the other fields the different methods and focuses of these fields always lead to different perspectives on altruism in simple terms altruism is caring about the welfare of other people and acting to help them

14,giving alms to the poor is often considered an altruistic action altruism or selflessness is the principle or practice of concern for the welfare of others it is a traditional virtue in many cultures and a core aspect of various religious traditions and secular worldviews though the concept of others toward whom concern should be directed can vary among cultures and religions altruism or selflessness is the opposite of selfishness the word was coined by the french philosopher auguste comte in french as altruisme for an antonym of egoism he derived it from the italian altrui which in turn was derived from latin alteri meaning other people or somebody else altruism in biological organisms can be defined as an individual performing an action which is at a cost to themselves eg pleasure and quality of life time probability of survival or reproduction but benefits either directly or indirectly another thirdparty individual without the expectation of reciprocity or compensation for that action steinberg suggests a definition for altruism in the clinical setting that is intentional and voluntary actions that aim to enhance the welfare of another person in the absence of any quid pro quo external rewards altruism can be distinguished from feelings of loyalty in that whilst the latter is predicated upon social relationships altruism does not consider relationships much debate exists as to whether true altruism is possible in human psychology the theory of psychological egoism suggests that no act of sharing helping or sacrificing can be described as truly altruistic as the actor may receive an intrinsic reward in the form of personal gratification the validity of this argument depends on whether intrinsic rewards qualify as benefits the actor also may not be expecting a reward the term altruism may also refer to an ethical doctrine that claims that individuals are morally obliged to benefit others used in this sense it is usually contrasted with egoism which is defined as acting to the benefit of ones self

14,anthropology marcel mausss book the gift contains a passage called note on alms this note describes the evolution of the notion of alms and by extension of altruism from the notion of sacrifice in it he writes alms are the fruits of a moral notion of the gift and of fortune on the one hand and of a notion of sacrifice on the other generosity is an obligation because nemesis avenges the poor and the gods for the superabundance of happiness and wealth of certain people who should rid themselves of it this is the ancient morality of the gift which has become a principle of justice the gods and the spirits accept that the share of wealth and happiness that has been offered to them and had been hitherto destroyed in useless sacrifices should serve the poor and children compare altruism ethics perception of altruism as selfsacrifice compare explanation of alms in various scriptures evolutionary explanations giving alms to beggar children in the science of ethology the study of animal behaviour and more generally in the study of social evolution altruism refers to behaviour by an individual that increases the fitness of another individual while decreasing the fitness of the actor in evolutionary psychology this may be applied to a wide range of human behaviors such as charity emergency aid help to coalition partners tipping courtship gifts production of public goods and environmentalism theories of apparently altruistic behavior were accelerated by the need to produce theories compatible with evolutionary origins two related strands of research on altruism have emerged from traditional evolutionary analyses and from evolutionary game theory a mathematical model and analysis of behavioural strategies some of the proposed mechanisms are kin selection that animals and humans are more altruistic towards close kin than to distant kin and nonkin has been confirmed in numerous studies across many different cultures even subtle cues indicating kinship may unconsciously increase altruistic behavior one kinship cue is facial resemblance one study found that slightly altering photographs so that they more closely resembled the faces of study participants increased the trust the participants expressed regarding depicted persons another cue is having the same family name especially if rare and this has been found to increase helpful behavior another study found more cooperative behavior the greater the number of perceived kin in a group using kinship terms in political speeches increased audience agreement with the speaker in one study this effect was especially strong for firstborns who are typically close to their families vested interests people are likely to suffer if their friends allies and similar social ingroups suffer or even disappear helping such group members may therefore eventually benefit the altruist making ingroup membership more noticeable increases cooperativeness extreme selfsacrifice towards the ingroup may be adaptive if a hostile outgroup threatens to kill the entire ingroup reciprocal altruism see also reciprocity evolution direct reciprocity research shows that it can be beneficial to help others if there is a chance that they can and will reciprocate the help the effective tit for tat strategy is one game theoretic example many people seem to be following a similar strategy by cooperating if and only if others cooperate in return one consequence is that people are more cooperative if it is more likely that individuals will interact again in the future people tend to be less cooperative if they perceive that the frequency of helpers in the population is lower they tend to help less if they see noncooperativeness by others and this effect tend to be stronger than the opposite effect of seeing cooperative behaviors simply changing the cooperative framing of a proposal may increase cooperativeness such as calling it a community game instead of a wall street game a tendency towards reciprocity implies that people will feel obligated to respond if someone helps them this has been used by charities that give small gifts to potential donors hoping thereby to induce reciprocity another method is to announce publicly that someone has given a large donation the tendency to reciprocate can even generalize so people become more helpful toward others in general after being helped on the other hand people will avoid or even retaliate against those perceived not to be cooperating people sometimes mistakenly fail to help when they intended to or their helping may not be noticed which may cause unintended conflicts as such it may be an optimal strategy to be slightly forgiving of and have a slightly generous interpretation of noncooperation people are more likely to cooperate on a task if they can communicate with one another first this may be due to better assessments of cooperativeness or due to exchange of promises they are more cooperative if they can gradually build trust instead of being asked to give extensive help immediately direct reciprocity and cooperation in a group can be increased by changing the focus and incentives from intragroup competition to larger scale competitions such as between groups or against the general population thus giving grades and promotions based only on an individuals performance relative to a small local group as is common may reduce cooperative behaviors in the group indirect reciprocity the avoidance of poor reciprocators and cheaters causes a persons reputation to become very important a person with a good reputation for reciprocity have a higher chance of receiving help even from persons they have had no direct interactions with previously strong reciprocity a form of reciprocity where some individuals seem to spend more resources on cooperating and punishing than would be most beneficial as predicted by several established theories of altruism a number of theories have been proposed as explanations as well as criticisms regarding its existence pseudoreciprocity an organism behaves altruistically and the recipient does not reciprocate but has an increased chance of acting in a way that is selfish but also as a byproduct benefits the altruist costly signaling and the handicap principle since altruism takes away resources from the altruist it can be an honest signal of resource availability and the abilities needed to gather resources this may signal to others that the altruist is a valuable potential partner it may also be a signal of interactive and cooperative intentions since those not interacting further in the future gain nothing from the costly signaling it is unclear if costly signaling can indicate a longterm cooperative personality but people have increased trust for those who help costly signaling is pointless if everyone has the same traits resources and cooperative intentions but become a potentially more important signal if the population increasingly varies on these characteristics hunters widely sharing the meat has been seen as a costly signal of ability and research has found that good hunters have higher reproductive success and more adulterous relations even if they themselves receive no more of the hunted meat than anyone else similarly holding large feasts and giving large donations has been seen as ways of demonstrating ones resources heroic risktaking has also been interpreted as a costly signal of ability volunteers assist hurricane victims at the houston astrodome following hurricane katrina both indirect reciprocity and costly signaling depend on the value of reputation and tend to make similar predictions one is that people will be more helping when they know that their helping behavior will be communicated to people they will interact with later is publicly announced is discussed or is simply being observed by someone else this have been documented in many studies the effect is sensitive to subtle cues such as people being more helpful when there were stylized eyespots instead of a logo on a computer screen weak reputational cues such as eyespots may become unimportant if there are stronger cues present and may lose their effect with continued exposure unless reinforced with real reputational effects public displays such as public weeping for dead celebrities and participation in demonstrations may be influenced by a desire to be seen as altruistic people who know that they are publicly monitored sometimes even wastefully donate money they know are not needed by recipient which may be because of reputational concerns women have been found to find altruistic men to be attractive partners when looking for a longterm partner altruism may be a preferred trait as it may indicate that he is also willing to share resources with her and her children it has been shown that men perform altruistic acts in the early stages of a romantic relationship or simply when in the presence of an attractive woman while both sexes state that kindness is the most preferable trait in a partner there is some evidence that men place less value on this than women and that women may not be more altruistic in presence of an attractive man men may even avoid altruistic women in shortterm relationships which may be because they expect less success people may compete over getting the benefits of a high reputation which may cause competitive altruism on the other hand in some experiments a proportion of people do not seem to care about reputation and they do not help more even if this is conspicuous this may possibly be due to reasons such as psychopathy or that they are so attractive that they need not be seen to be altruistic the reputational benefits of altruism occur in the future as compared to the immediate costs of altruism in the present while humans and other organisms generally place less value on future costsbenefits as compared to those in the present some have shorter time horizons than others and these people tend to be less cooperative explicit extrinsic rewards and punishments have been found to sometimes actually have the opposite effect on behaviors compared to intrinsic rewards this may be because such extrinsic topdown incentives may replace partially or in whole intrinsic and reputational incentives motivating the person to focus on obtaining the extrinsic rewards which overall may make the behaviors less desirable another effect is that people would like altruism to be due to a personality characteristic rather than due to overt reputational concerns and simply pointing out that there are reputational benefits of an action may actually reduce them this may possibly be used as derogatory tactic against altruists especially by those who are noncooperators a counterargument is that doing good due to reputational concerns is better than doing no good at all group selection it has controversially been argued by some evolutionary scientists such as david sloan wilson that natural selection can act at the level of nonkin groups to produce adaptations that benefit a nonkin group even if these adaptions are detrimental at the individual level thus while altruistic persons may under some circumstances be outcompeted by less altruistic persons at the individual level according to group selection theory the opposite may occur at the group level where groups consisting of the more altruistic persons may outcompete groups consisting of the less altruistic persons such altruism may only extend to ingroup members while there may instead prejudice and antagonism against outgroup members see also ingroup favoritism group selection theory has been criticized by many other evolutionary scientists homeless in new york city such explanations do not imply that humans are always consciously calculating how to increase their inclusive fitness when they are doing altruistic acts instead evolution has shaped psychological mechanisms such as emotions that promote altruistic behaviors every single instance of altruistic behavior need not always increase inclusive fitness altruistic behaviors would have been selected for if such behaviors on average increased inclusive fitness in the ancestral environment this need not imply that on average 50 or more of altruistic acts were beneficial for the altruist in the ancestral environment if the benefits from helping the right person were very high it would be beneficial to err on the side of caution and usually be altruistic even if in most cases there were no benefits the benefits for the altruist may be increased and the costs reduced by being more altruistic towards certain groups research has found that people are more altruistic to kin than to nokin to friends than to strangers to those attractive than to those unattractive to noncompetitors than to competitors and to members ingroups than to members of outgroup the study of altruism was the initial impetus behind george r prices development of the price equation which is a mathematical equation used to study genetic evolution an interesting example of altruism is found in the cellular slime moulds such as dictyostelium mucoroides these protists live as individual amoebae until starved at which point they aggregate and form a multicellular fruiting body in which some cells sacrifice themselves to promote the survival of other cells in the fruiting body selective investment theory proposes that close social bonds and associated emotional cognitive and neurohormonal mechanisms evolved in order to facilitate longterm highcost altruism between those closely depending on one another for survival and reproductive success such cooperative behaviors have sometimes been seen as arguments for leftwing politics such by the russian zoologist and anarchist peter kropotkin in his 1902 book mutual aid a factor of evolution and peter singer in his book a darwinian left initial evolutionary problematics there are problems of early stage evolution of altruism a first emotionally empathic individual would if it was genetic have been effectively exploited to death by the preexisting nonempathic individuals this applies regardless how far back in evolution the problem is moved not restricted to hominid but extending to prereptilian or anything in between including early mammals the first empathic individual would effectively be exploited every time another individual was in the right place at the right time to take advantage so no evolutionary adaptation to exploiting empathic individuals would be required for the lethality to take effect it is de facto impossible that mutations for emotional empathy ability to recognize it in others and a direction of it towards those individuals would all occur at the same time an ability to recognize a nonexistent behavior is of no evolutionary use and so cannot have preevolved neurobiology jorge moll and jordan grafman neuroscientists at the national institutes of health and labsdor hospital network jm provided the first evidence for the neural bases of altruistic giving in normal healthy volunteers using functional magnetic resonance imaging in their research published in the proceedings of the national academy of sciences usa in october 2006 they showed that both pure monetary rewards and charitable donations activated the mesolimbic reward pathway a primitive part of the brain that usually responds to food and sex however when volunteers generously placed the interests of others before their own by making charitable donations another brain circuit was selectively activated the subgenual cortexseptal region these structures are intimately related to social attachment and bonding in other species altruism the experiment suggested was not a superior moral faculty that suppresses basic selfish urges but rather was basic to the brain hardwired and pleasurable one brain region the subgenual anterior cingulate cortexbasal forebrain contributes to learning altruistic behavior especially in those with trait empathy the same study has shown a connection between giving to charity and the promotion of social bonding in another study in the 1990s dr bill harbaugh a university of oregon economist concluded people are motivated to give for reasons of personal prestige and in a similar fmri scanner test in 2007 with his psychologist colleague dr ulrich mayr reached the same conclusions of jorge moll and jordan grafman about giving to charity although they were able to divide the study group into two groups egoists and altruists one of their discoveries was that though rarely even some of the considered egoists sometimes gave more than expected because that would help others leading to the conclusion that there are other factors in cause in charity such as a persons environment and values psychology the international encyclopedia of the social sciences defines psychological altruism as a motivational state with the goal of increasing anothers welfare psychological altruism is contrasted with psychological egoism which refers to the motivation to increase ones own welfare there has been some debate on whether or not humans are truly capable of psychological altruism some definitions specify a selfsacrificial nature to altruism and a lack of external rewards for altruistic behaviors however because altruism ultimately benefits the self in many cases the selflessness of altruistic acts is brought to question the social exchange theory postulates that altruism only exists when benefits to the self outweigh costs to the self daniel batson is a psychologist who examined this question and argues against the social exchange theory he identified four major motives for altruism altruism to ultimately benefit the self egoism to ultimately benefit the other person altruism to benefit a group collectivism or to uphold a moral principle principlism altruism that ultimately serves selfish gains is thus differentiated from selfless altruism but the general conclusion has been that empathyinduced altruism can be genuinely selfless the empathyaltruism hypothesis basically states that psychological altruism does exist and is evoked by the empathic desire to help someone who is suffering feelings of empathic concern are contrasted with feelings of personal distress which compel people to reduce their own unpleasant emotions people with empathic concern help others in distress even when exposure to the situation could be easily avoided whereas those lacking in empathic concern avoid helping unless it is difficult or impossible to avoid exposure to anothers suffering helping behavior is seen in humans at about two years old when a toddler is capable of understanding subtle emotional cues peace corps trainees swearing in as volunteers in cambodia 4 april 2007 in psychological research on altruism studies often observe altruism as demonstrated through prosocial behaviors such as helping comforting sharing cooperation philanthropy and community service research has found that people are most likely to help if they recognize that a person is in need and feel personal responsibility for reducing the persons distress research also suggests that the number of bystanders witnessing distress or suffering affects the likelihood of helping the bystander effect greater numbers of bystanders decrease individual feelings of responsibility however a witness with a high level of empathic concern is likely to assume personal responsibility entirely regardless of the number of bystanders a feeling of personal responsibility or moral norm has also strongly been associated with other prosocial behaviors such as charitable giving many studies have observed the effects of volunteerism as a form of altruism on happiness and health and have consistently found a strong connection between volunteerism and current and future health and wellbeing in a study of older adults those who volunteered were higher on life satisfaction and will to live and lower in depression anxiety and somatization volunteerism and helping behavior have not only been shown to improve mental health but physical health and longevity as well attributable to the activity and social integration it encourages one study examined the physical health of mothers who volunteered over a 30year period and found that 52 of those who did not belong to a volunteer organization experienced a major illness while only 36 of those who did volunteer experienced one a study on adults ages 55 found that during the fouryear study period people who volunteered for two or more organizations had a 63 lower likelihood of dying after controlling for prior health status it was determined that volunteerism accounted for a 44 reduction in mortality merely being aware of kindness in oneself and others is also associated with greater wellbeing a study that asked participants to count each act of kindness they performed for one week significantly enhanced their subjective happiness it is important to note that while research supports the idea that altruistic acts bring about happiness it has also been found to work in the opposite directionthat happier people are also kinder the relationship between altruistic behavior and happiness is bidirectional studies have found that generosity increases linearly from sad to happy affective states studies have also been careful to note that feeling overtaxed by the needs of others has conversely negative effects on health and happiness for example one study on volunteerism found that feeling overwhelmed by others demands had an even stronger negative effect on mental health than helping had a positive one although positive effects were still significant additionally while generous acts make people feel good about themselves it is also important for people to appreciate the kindness they receive from others studies suggest that gratitude goes handinhand with kindness and is also very important for our wellbeing a study on the relationship happiness to various character strengths showed that a conscious focus on gratitude led to reductions in negative affect and increases in optimistic appraisals positive affect offering emotional support sleep quality and wellbeing psychologists generally refer to this virtuous cycle of helping others doing good and subsequently feeling good as the helpers high sociology sociologists have long been concerned with how to build the good society altruism morality and social solidarity american sociological association the structure of our societies and how individuals come to exhibit charitable philanthropic and other prosocial altruistic actions for the common good is a largely researched topic within the field the american sociology association asa acknowledges public sociology saying the intrinsic scientific policy and public relevance of this field of investigation in helping to construct good societies is unquestionable altruism morality and social solidarity asa this type of sociology seeks contributions that aid grassroots and theoretical understandings of what motivates altruism and how it is organized and promotes an altruistic focus in order to benefit the world and people it studies how altruism is framed organized carried out and what motivates it at the group level is an area of focus that sociologists seek to investigate in order to contribute back to the groups it studies and build the good society pathological altruism pathological altruism is when altruism is taken to an unhealthy extreme and either harms the altruistic person or wellintentioned actions cause more harm than good the term pathological altruism was popularised by the book pathological altruism examples include depression and burnout seen in healthcare professionals an unhealthy focus on others to the detriment of ones own needs hoarding of animals and ineffective philanthropic and social programs that ultimately worsen the situations they are meant to aid
14,most if not all of the worlds religions promote altruism as a very important moral value buddhism christianity hinduism islam jainism judaism and sikhism etc place particular emphasis on altruistic morality buddhism monks collecting alms altruism figures prominently in buddhism love and compassion are components of all forms of buddhism and are focused on all beings equally love is the wish that all beings be happy and compassion is the wish that all beings be free from suffering many illnesses can be cured by the one medicine of love and compassion these qualities are the ultimate source of human happiness and the need for them lies at the very core of our being dalai lama since all beings includes the individual love and compassion in buddhism are outside the opposition between self and other it is even said that the distinction between self and other is part of the root cause of our suffering in practical terms however since most of us are spontaneously selfcentered buddhism encourages us to focus love and compassion on others and thus can be characterized as altruistic many would agree with the dalai lama that buddhism as a religion is kindness toward others still the notion of altruism is modified in such a worldview since the belief is that such a practice promotes our own happiness the more we care for the happiness of others the greater our own sense of wellbeing becomes dalai lama in the context of larger ethical discussions on moral action and judgment buddhism is characterized by the belief that negative unhappy consequences of our actions derive not from punishment or correction based on moral judgment but from the law of karma which functions like a natural law of cause and effect a simple illustration of such cause and effect is the case of experiencing the effects of what one causes if one causes suffering then as a natural consequence one would experience suffering if one causes happiness then as a natural consequence one would experience happiness in buddhism karma pāli kamma is strictly distinguished from vipāka meaning fruit or result karma is categorized within the group or groups of cause pāli hetu in the chain of cause and effect where it comprises the elements of volitional activities pali sankhara and action pali bhava any action is understood to create seeds in the mind that sprout into the appropriate results pāli vipaka when they meet the right conditions most types of karmas with good or bad results will keep one in the wheel of samsāra others will liberate one to nirvāna buddhism relates karma directly to motives behind an action motivation usually makes the difference between good and bad but motivation also includes the aspect of ignorance so a wellintended action from an ignorant mind can easily be bad in that it creates unpleasant results for the actor in buddhism karma is not the only cause of all that happens as taught in the early texts the commentarial tradition classified causal mechanisms governing the universe in five categories known as niyama dhammas kamma niyama consequences of ones actions utu niyama seasonal changes and climate biija niyama laws of heredity citta niyama will of mind dhamma niyama natures tendency to produce a perfect type jainism sculpture depicting the jain concept of ahimsa noninjury the fundamental principles of jainism revolve around the concept of altruism not only for humans but for all sentient beings jainism preaches the view of ahimsa to live and let live thereby not harming sentient beings ie uncompromising reverence for all life it also considers all living things to be equal the first tirthankara rishabhdev introduced the concept of altruism for all living beings from extending knowledge and experience to others to donation giving oneself up for others nonviolence and compassion for all living things jainism prescribes a path of nonviolence to progress the soul to this ultimate goal a major characteristic of jain belief is the emphasis on the consequences of not only physical but also mental behaviors ones unconquered mind with anger pride ego deceit greed and uncontrolled sense organs are the powerful enemies of humans anger spoils good relations pride destroys humility deceit destroys peace and greed destroys everything jainism recommends conquering anger by forgiveness pride by humility deceit by straightforwardness and greed by contentment jains believe that to attain enlightenment and ultimately liberation one must practice the following ethical principles major vows in thought speech and action the degree to which these principles are practiced is different for householders and monks they are nonviolence ahimsa truthfulness satya nonstealing asteya celibacy brahmacharya nonpossession or nonmaterialism aparigraha the great vows mahavrata are prescribed for monks and limited vows anuvrata are prescribed for householders the householders are encouraged to practice the abovementioned five vows the monks have to observe them very strictly with consistent practice it will be possible to overcome the limitations gradually accelerating the spiritual progress the principle of nonviolence seeks to minimize karmas which limit the capabilities of the soul jainism views every soul as worthy of respect because it has the potential to become siddha god in jainism because all living beings possess a soul great care and awareness is essential in ones actions jainism emphasizes the equality of all life advocating harmlessness towards all whether the creatures are great or small this policy extends even to microscopic organisms jainism acknowledges that every person has different capabilities and capacities to practice and therefore accepts different levels of compliance for ascetics and householders christianity statue of mother teresa in india altruism is central to the teachings of jesus found in the gospel especially in the sermon on the mount and the sermon on the plain from biblical to medieval christian traditions tensions between selfaffirmation and otherregard were sometimes discussed under the heading of disinterested love as in the pauline phrase love seeks not its own interests in his book indoctrination and selfdeception roderick hindery tries to shed light on these tensions by contrasting them with impostors of authentic selfaffirmation and altruism by analysis of otherregard within creative individuation of the self and by contrasting love for the few with love for the many love confirms others in their freedom shuns propaganda and masks assures others of its presence and is ultimately confirmed not by mere declarations from others but by each persons experience and practice from within as in practical arts the presence and meaning of love becomes validated and grasped not by words and reflections alone but in the making of the connection st thomas aquinas interprets you should love your neighbour as yourself as meaning that love for ourselves is the exemplar of love for others considering that the love with which a man loves himself is the form and root of friendship and quotes aristotle that the origin of friendly relations with others lies in our relations to ourselves he concluded that though we are not bound to love others more than ourselves we naturally seek the common good the good of the whole more than any private good the good of a part however he thinks we should love god more than ourselves and our neighbours and more than our bodily lifesince the ultimate purpose of loving our neighbour is to share in eternal beatitude a more desirable thing than bodily well being in coining the word altruism as stated above comte was probably opposing this thomistic doctrine which is present in some theological schools within catholicism many biblical authors draw a strong connection between love of others and love of god 1 john 4 states that for one to love god one must love his fellowman and that hatred of ones fellowman is the same as hatred of god thomas jay oord has argued in several books that altruism is but one possible form of love an altruistic action is not always a loving action oord defines altruism as acting for the others good and he agrees with feminists who note that sometimes love requires acting for ones own good when the others demands undermine overall wellbeing german philosopher max scheler distinguishes two ways in which the strong can help the weak one way is a sincere expression of christian love motivated by a powerful feeling of security strength and inner salvation of the invincible fullness of ones own life and existence another way is merely one of the many modern substitutes for love nothing but the urge to turn away from oneself and to lose oneself in other peoples business at its worst scheler says love for the small the poor the weak and the oppressed is really disguised hatred repressed envy an impulse to detract etc directed against the opposite phenomena wealth strength power largesse islam in islam the concept īthār إيثار altruism is the notion of preferring others to oneself for sufis this means devotion to others through complete forgetfulness of ones own concerns where concern for others is rooted to be a demand made by allah on the human body considered to be property of allah alone the importance lies in sacrifice for the sake of the greater good islam considers those practicing īthār as abiding by the highest degree of nobility this is similar to the notion of chivalry but unlike that european concept in ithar attention is focused on everything in existence a constant concern for allah ie god results in a careful attitude towards people animals and other things in this world this concept was emphasized by sufis of islam like rabia aladawiyya who paid attention to the difference between dedication to allah ie god and dedication to people thirteenthcentury turkish sufi poet yunus emre explained this philosophy as yaratılanı severiz yaratandan ötürü or we love the creature because of the creator for many muslims ithar must be practiced as a religious obligation during specific islamic holidays however ithar is also still an islamic ideal to which all muslims should strive to adhere at all times judaism judaism defines altruism as the desired goal of creation the famous rabbi abraham isaac kook stated that love is the most important attribute in humanity this is defined as bestowal or giving which is the intention of altruism this can be altruism towards humanity that leads to altruism towards the creator or god kabbalah defines god as the force of giving in existence rabbi moshe chaim luzzatto in particular focused on the purpose of creation and how the will of god was to bring creation into perfection and adhesion with this upper force modern kabbalah developed by rabbi yehuda ashlag in his writings about the future generation focuses on how society could achieve an altruistic social framework ashlag proposed that such a framework is the purpose of creation and everything that happens is to raise humanity to the level of altruism love for one another ashlag focused on society and its relation to divinity sikhism altruism is essential to the sikh religion the central faith in sikhism is that the greatest deed any one can do is to imbibe and live the godly qualities like love affection sacrifice patience harmony truthfulness the fifth nanak guru arjun dev sacrificed his life to uphold 22 carats of pure truth the greatest gift to humanity the guru granth the ninth guru guru tegh bahadur sacrificed his head to protect weak and defenseless people against atrocity in the late seventeenth century guru gobind singh ji the tenth guru in sikhism was in war with the mughal rulers to protect the people of different faiths when a fellow sikh bhai kanhaiya attended the troops of the enemy he gave water to both friends and foes who were wounded on the battlefield some of the enemy began to fight again and some sikh warriors were annoyed by bhai kanhaiya as he was helping their enemy sikh soldiers brought bhai kanhaiya before guru gobind singh ji and complained of his action that they considered counterproductive to their struggle on the battlefield what were you doing and why asked the guru i was giving water to the wounded because i saw your face in all of them replied bhai kanhaiya the guru responded then you should also give them ointment to heal their wounds you were practicing what you were coached in the house of the guru it was under the tutelage of the guru that bhai kanhaiya subsequently founded a volunteer corps for altruism this volunteer corps still to date is engaged in doing good to others and trains new volunteering recruits for doing the same hinduism swami sivananda an advaita scholar reiterates the same views in his commentary synthesising vedanta views on the brahma sutras a vedantic text in his commentary on chapter 3 of the brahma sutras sivananda notes that karma is insentient and shortlived and ceases to exist as soon as a deed is executed hence karma cannot bestow the fruits of actions at a future date according to ones merit furthermore one cannot argue that karma generates apurva or punya which gives fruit since apurva is nonsentient it cannot act unless moved by an intelligent being such as a god it cannot independently bestow reward or punishment however the very well known and popular text the bhagavad gita supports the doctrine of karma yoga selfless action or action without desire for personal gain which can be said to encompass altruism altruistic acts are generally celebrated and very well received in hindu literature and is central to hindu morality

reviews were more positive than the reviews she received for her later work her 1938 novella anthem received little attention from reviewers both for its first publication in england and for subsequent reissues rands first bestseller the fountainhead received far fewer reviews than we the living and reviewers opinions were mixed there was a positive review in the new york times that rand greatly appreciated the reviewer called rand a writer of great power who wrote brilliantly beautifully and bitterly and stated that you will not be able to read this masterful book without thinking through some of the basic concepts of our time there were other positive reviews but rand dismissed most of them as either not understanding her message or as being from unimportant publications some negative reviews focused on the length of the novel such as one that called it a whale of a book and another that said anyone who is taken in by it deserves a stern lecture on paperrationing other negative reviews called the characters unsympathetic and rands style offensively pedestrian rands 1957 novel atlas shrugged was widely reviewed and many of the reviews were strongly negative in the national review conservative author whittaker chambers called the book sophomoric and remarkably silly he described the tone of the book as shrillness without reprieve and accused rand of supporting a godless system which he related to that of the soviets claiming from almost any page of atlas shrugged a voice can be heard from painful necessity commanding to a gas chambergo atlas shrugged received positive reviews from a few publications including praise from the noted book reviewer john chamberlain but rand scholar mimi reisel gladstein later wrote that reviewers seemed to vie with each other in a contest to devise the cleverest putdowns calling it execrable claptrap and a nightmare they said it was written out of hate and showed remorseless hectoring and prolixity author flannery oconnor wrote in a letter to a friend that the fiction of ayn rand is as low as you can get re fiction i hope you picked it up off the floor of the subway and threw it in the nearest garbage pail rands nonfiction received far fewer reviews than her novels had the tenor of the criticism for her first nonfiction book for the new intellectual was similar to that for atlas shrugged with philosopher sidney hook likening her certainty to the way philosophy is written in the soviet union and author gore vidal calling her viewpoint nearly perfect in its immorality her subsequent books got progressively less attention from reviewers on the 100th anniversary of rands birth in 2005 edward rothstein writing for the new york times referred to her fictional writing as quaint utopian retro fantasy and programmatic neoromanticism of the misunderstood artist while criticizing her characters isolated rejection of democratic society in 2007 book critic leslie clark described her fiction as romance novels with a patina of pseudophilosophy in 2009 gqs critic columnist tom carson described her books as capitalisms version of middlebrow religious novels such as benhur and the left behind series popular interest the american adventure rotunda at walt disney worlds epcot in 1991 a survey conducted for the library of congress and the bookofthemonth club asked club members what the most influential book in the respondents life was rands atlas shrugged was the second most popular choice after the bible rands books continue to be widely sold and read with over 29 million copies sold as of 2013 with about 10 of that total purchased for free distribution to schools by the ayn rand institute in 1998 modern library readers voted atlas shrugged the 20th centurys finest work of fiction followed by the fountainhead in second place anthem in seventh and we the living eighth none of the four appeared on the critics list although rands influence has been greatest in the united states there has been international interest in her work rands work continues to be among the top sellers among books in india rands contemporary admirers included fellow novelists such as ira levin kay nolte smith and l neil smith and later writers such as erika holzer and terry goodkind have been influenced by her other artists who have cited rand as an important influence on their lives and thought include comic book artist steve ditko and musician neil peart of rush rand provided a positive view of business and in response business executives and entrepreneurs have admired and promoted her work john allison of bbt and ed snider of comcast spectacor have funded the promotion of rands ideas while mark cuban owner of the dallas mavericks and john p mackey ceo of whole foods among others have said they consider rand crucial to their success rand and her works have been referred to in a variety of media on television shows including animated sitcoms liveaction comedies dramas and game shows as well as in movies and video games she or a character based on her figures prominently in positive and negative lights in literary and science fiction novels by prominent american authors nick gillespie editor in chief of reason has remarked that rands is a tortured immortality one in which shes as likely to be a punch line as a protagonist and that jibes at rand as cold and inhuman run through the popular culture two movies have been made about rands life a 1997 documentary film ayn rand a sense of life was nominated for the academy award for documentary feature the passion of ayn rand a 1999 television adaptation of the book of the same name won several awards rands image also appears on a 1999 us postage stamp designed by artist nick gaetano political influence although she rejected the labels conservative and libertarian rand has had continuing influence on rightwing politics and libertarianism jim powell a senior fellow at the cato institute considers rand one of the three most important women along with rose wilder lane and isabel paterson of modern american libertarianism and david nolan one of the founders of the libertarian party stated that without ayn rand the libertarian movement would not exist in his history of the libertarian movement journalist brian doherty described her as the most influential libertarian of the twentieth century to the public at large and biographer jennifer burns referred to her as the ultimate gateway drug to life on the right tea party rally carries a sign referring to john galt the hero of rands novel atlas shruggedaltin a large outdoor crowd a man holds up a poster with the words i am john galt in all capital letters she faced intense opposition from william f buckley jr and other contributors for the national review magazine they published numerous criticisms in the 1950s and 1960s by whittaker chambers garry wills and m stanton evans nevertheless her influence among conservatives forced buckley and other national review contributors to reconsider how traditional notions of virtue and christianity could be integrated with support for capitalism the political figures who cite rand as an influence are usually conservatives often members of the united states republican party despite rand taking some positions that are atypical for conservatives such as being prochoice and an atheist a 1987 article in the new york times referred to her as the reagan administrations novelist laureate republican congressmen and conservative pundits have acknowledged her influence on their lives and recommended her novels the financial crisis of 20072008 spurred renewed interest in her works especially atlas shrugged which some saw as foreshadowing the crisis and opinion articles compared realworld events with the plot of the novel during this time signs mentioning rand and her fictional hero john galt appeared at tea party protests there was also increased criticism of her ideas especially from the political left with critics blaming the economic crisis on her support of selfishness and free markets particularly through her influence on alan greenspan for example mother jones remarked that rands particular genius has always been her ability to turn upside down traditional hierarchies and recast the wealthy the talented and the powerful as the oppressed while equating randian individual wellbeing with that of the volk according to goebbels corey robin of the nation alleged similarities between the moral syntax of randianism and fascism academic reaction during rands lifetime her work received little attention from academic scholars when the first academic book about rands philosophy appeared in 1971 its author declared writing about rand a treacherous undertaking that could lead to guilt by association for taking her seriously a few articles about rands ideas appeared in academic journals before her death in 1982 many of them in the personalist one of these was on the randian argument by libertarian philosopher robert nozick who argued that her metaethical argument is unsound and fails to solve the isought problem posed by david hume some responses to nozick by other academic philosophers were also published in the personalist arguing that nozick misstated rands case academic consideration of rand as a literary figure during her life was even more limited academic mimi gladstein was unable to find any scholarly articles about rands novels when she began researching her in 1973 and only three such articles appeared during the rest of the 1970s since rands death interest in her work has gradually increased historian jennifer burns has identified three overlapping waves of scholarly interest in rand the most recent of which is an explosion of scholarship since the year 2000 however few universities currently include rand or objectivism as a philosophical specialty or research area with many literature and philosophy departments dismissing her as a pop culture phenomenon rather than a subject for serious study gladstein chris matthew sciabarra allan gotthelf edwin a locke and tara smith have taught her work in academic institutions sciabarra coedits the journal of ayn rand studies a nonpartisan peerreviewed journal dedicated to the study of rands philosophical and literary work in 1987 gotthelf helped found the ayn rand society with george walsh and david kelley and has been active in sponsoring seminars about rand and her ideas smith has written several academic books and papers on rands ideas including ayn rands normative ethics the virtuous egoist a volume on rands ethical theory published by cambridge university press rands ideas have also been made subjects of study at clemson and duke universities scholars of english and american literature have largely ignored her work although attention to her literary work has increased since the 1990s rand scholars douglas den uyl and douglas b rasmussen while stressing the importance and originality of her thought describe her style as literary hyperbolic and emotional philosopher jack wheeler says that despite the incessant bombast and continuous venting of randian rage rands ethics are a most immense achievement the study of which is vastly more fruitful than any other in contemporary thought in the literary encyclopedia entry for rand written in 2001 john david lewis declared that rand wrote the most intellectually challenging fiction of her generation in a 1999 interview in the chronicle of higher education sciabarra commented i know they laugh at rand while forecasting a growth of interest in her work in the academic community libertarian philosopher michael huemer has argued that very few people find rands ideas convincing especially her ethics which he believes is difficult to interpret and may lack logical coherence he attributes the attention she receives to her being a compelling writer especially as a novelist thus atlas shrugged outsells rands nonfiction works as well as the works of other philosophers of classical liberalism such as ludwig von mises friedrich hayek or frederic bastiat political scientist charles murray while praising rands literary accomplishments criticizes her claim that her only philosophical debt was to aristotle instead asserting that her ideas were derivative of previous thinkers such as john locke and friedrich nietzsche although rand maintained that objectivism was an integrated philosophical system philosopher robert h bass has argued that her central ethical ideas are inconsistent and contradictory to her central political ideas objectivist movement in 1985 rands intellectual heir leonard peikoff established the ayn rand institute a nonprofit organization dedicated to promoting rands ideas and works in 1990 after an ideological disagreement with peikoff philosopher david kelley founded the institute for objectivist studies now known as the atlas society in 2001 historian john mccaskey organized the anthem foundation for objectivist scholarship which provides grants for scholarly work on objectivism in academia the charitable foundation of bbt corporation has also given grants for teaching rands ideas or works the university of texas at austin the university of pittsburgh and university of north carolina at chapel hill are among the schools that have received grants in some cases these grants have been controversial due to their requiring research or teaching related to rand
15,early life rand was born alisa zinovyevna rosenbaum on february 2 1905 to a russian jewish bourgeois family living in saint petersburg she was the eldest of the three daughters of zinovy zakharovich rosenbaum and his wife anna borisovna née kaplan largely nonobservant jews zinovy rosenbaum was a successful pharmacist and businessman eventually owning a pharmacy and the building in which it was located with a passion for the liberal arts rand later said she found school unchallenging and she began writing screenplays at the age of eight and novels at the age of ten at the prestigious stoiunina gymnasium her closest friend was vladimir nabokovs younger sister olga the two girls shared an intense interest in politics and would engage in debates at the nabokov mansion while nabokova defended constitutional monarchy rand supported republican ideals she was twelve at the time of the february revolution of 1917 during which she favored alexander kerensky over tsar nicholas ii the subsequent october revolution and the rule of the bolsheviks under vladimir lenin disrupted the life the family had previously enjoyed her fathers business was confiscated and the family displaced they fled to the crimean peninsula which was initially under control of the white army during the russian civil war she later recalled that while in high school she determined that she was an atheist and that she valued reason above any other human virtue after graduating from high school in the crimea at 16 rand returned with her family to petrograd as saint petersburg was renamed at that time where they faced desperate conditions on occasion nearly starving rand completed a threeyear program at petrograd state university after the russian revolution universities were opened to women allowing rand to be in the first group of women to enroll at petrograd state university where at the age of 16 she began her studies in the department of social pedagogy majoring in history at the university she was introduced to the writings of aristotle and plato who would be her greatest influence and counterinfluence respectively she also studied the philosophical works of friedrich nietzsche able to read french german and russian rand also discovered the writers fyodor dostoevsky victor hugo edmond rostand and friedrich schiller who became her perennial favorites along with many other bourgeois students rand was purged from the university shortly before graduating after complaints from a group of visiting foreign scientists however many of the purged students were allowed to complete their work and graduate which rand did in october 1924 she subsequently studied for a year at the state technicum for screen arts in leningrad for one of her assignments she wrote an essay about the polish actress pola negri which became her first published work by this time she had decided her professional surname for writing would be rand possibly because it is graphically similar to a vowelless excerpt рзнб of her birth surname in cyrillic handwriting and she adopted the first name ayn either from a finnish name aino or from the hebrew word ayin meaning eye arrival in the united states cover of rands first published work a 2500word monograph on femme fatale pola negri published in 1925 in the autumn of 1925 rand was granted a visa to visit american relatives she departed on january 17 1926 when she arrived in new york city on february 19 1926 she was so impressed with the skyline of manhattan that she cried what she later called tears of splendor intent on staying in the united states to become a screenwriter she lived for a few months with relatives in chicago one of whom owned a movie theater and allowed her to watch dozens of films for free she then set out for hollywood california initially rand struggled in hollywood and took odd jobs to pay her basic living expenses a chance meeting with famed director cecil b demille led to a job as an extra in his film the king of kings as well as subsequent work as a junior screenwriter while working on the king of kings she met an aspiring young actor frank oconnor the two were married on april 15 1929 she became a permanent us resident in july 1929 and became an american citizen on march 3 1931 taking various jobs during the 1930s to support her writing she worked for a time as the head of the costume department at rko studios she made several attempts to bring her parents and sisters to the united states but they were unable to acquire permission to emigrate early fiction rands first literary success came with the sale of her screenplay red pawn to universal studios in 1932 although it was never produced this was followed by the courtroom drama night of january 16th first produced by ee clive in hollywood in 1934 and then successfully reopened on broadway in 1935 each night the jury was selected from members of the audience and one of the two different endings depending on the jurys verdict would then be performed in 1941 paramount pictures produced a movie loosely based on the play rand did not participate in the production and was highly critical of the result ideal is a novel and play written in 1934 which were first published in 2015 by her estate the heroine is an actress who embodies randian ideals rands first published novel the semiautobiographical we the living was published in 1936 set in soviet russia it focused on the struggle between the individual and the state in a 1959 foreword to the novel rand stated that we the living is as near to an autobiography as i will ever write it is not an autobiography in the literal but only in the intellectual sense the plot is invented the background is not initial sales were slow and the american publisher let it go out of print although european editions continued to sell after the success of her later novels rand was able to release a revised version in 1959 that has since sold over three million copies in 1942 without rands knowledge or permission the novel was made into a pair of italian films noi vivi and addio kira rediscovered in the 1960s these films were reedited into a new version which was approved by rand and rereleased as we the living in 1986 her novella anthem was written during a break from the writing of her next major novel the fountainhead it presents a vision of a dystopian future world in which totalitarian collectivism has triumphed to such an extent that even the word i has been forgotten and replaced with we it was published in england in 1938 but rand initially could not find an american publisher as with we the living rands later success allowed her to get a revised version published in 1946 which has sold more than 35 million copies the fountainhead and political activism during the 1940s rand became politically active both she and her husband worked fulltime in volunteer positions for the 1940 presidential campaign of republican wendell willkie this work led to rands first public speaking experiences including fielding the sometimes hostile questions from new york city audiences who had just viewed prowillkie newsreels an experience she greatly enjoyed this activity also brought her into contact with other intellectuals sympathetic to freemarket capitalism she became friends with journalist henry hazlitt and his wife and hazlitt introduced her to the austrian school economist ludwig von mises despite her philosophical differences with them rand strongly endorsed the writings of both men throughout her career and both of them expressed admiration for her once mises referred to rand as the most courageous man in america a compliment that particularly pleased her because he said man instead of woman rand also developed a friendship with libertarian writer isabel paterson rand questioned the wellinformed paterson about american history and politics long into the night during their numerous meetings and gave paterson ideas for her only nonfiction book the god of the machine rands first major success as a writer came with the fountainhead in 1943 a romantic and philosophical novel that she wrote over a period of seven years the novel centers on an uncompromising young architect named howard roark and his struggle against what rand described as secondhandersthose who attempt to live through others placing others above themselves it was rejected by twelve publishers before finally being accepted by the bobbsmerrill company on the insistence of editor archibald ogden who threatened to quit if his employer did not publish it while completing the novel rand was prescribed benzedrine a brand of amphetamine to fight fatigue the drug helped her to work long hours to meet her deadline for delivering the finished novel but when the book was done she was so exhausted that her doctor ordered two weeks rest her use of the drug for approximately three decades may have contributed to what some of her later associates described as volatile mood swings the fountainhead eventually became a worldwide success bringing rand fame and financial security in 1943 rand sold the rights for a film version to warner bros and she returned to hollywood to write the screenplay finishing her work on that screenplay she was hired by producer hal wallis as a screenwriter and scriptdoctor her work for wallis included the screenplays for the oscarnominated love letters and you came along this role gave rand time to work on other projects including a planned nonfiction treatment of her philosophy to be called the moral basis of individualism although the planned book was never completed a condensed version was published as an essay titled the only path to tomorrow in the january 1944 edition of readers digest magazine rand extended her involvement with freemarket and anticommunist activism while working in hollywood she became involved with the motion picture alliance for the preservation of american ideals a hollywood anticommunist group and wrote articles on the groups behalf she also joined the anticommunist american writers association a visit by isabel paterson to meet with rands california associates led to a final falling out between the two when paterson made comments which rand considered rude to valued political allies in 1947 during the second red scare rand testified as a friendly witness before the united states house unamerican activities committee her testimony described the disparity between her personal experiences in the soviet union and the portrayal of it in the 1944 film song of russia rand argued that the film grossly misrepresented conditions in the soviet union portraying life there as being much better and happier than it actually was she wanted to also criticize the lauded 1946 film the best years of our lives for what she interpreted as its negative presentation of the business world but she was not allowed to testify about it when asked after the hearings about her feelings on the effectiveness of the investigations rand described the process as futile after several delays the film version of the fountainhead was released in 1949 although it used rands screenplay with minimal alterations she disliked the movie from beginning to end complaining about its editing acting and other elements atlas shrugged and objectivism rands novella anthem was reprinted in the june 1953 issue of the pulp magazine famous fantastic mysteries in the years following the publication of the fountainhead rand received numerous letters from readers some of whom the book profoundly influenced in 1951 rand moved from los angeles to new york city where she gathered a group of these admirers around her this group jokingly designated the collective included future federal reserve chairman alan greenspan a young psychology student named nathan blumenthal later nathaniel branden and his wife barbara and barbaras cousin leonard peikoff at first the group was an informal gathering of friends who met with rand on weekends at her apartment to discuss philosophy later she began allowing them to read the drafts of her new novel atlas shrugged as the manuscript pages were written in 1954 rands close relationship with the younger nathaniel branden turned into a romantic affair with the consent of their spouses atlas shrugged published in 1957 was considered rands magnum opus rand described the theme of the novel as the role of the mind in mans existenceand as a corollary the demonstration of a new moral philosophy the morality of rational selfinterest it advocates the core tenets of rands philosophy of objectivism and expresses her concept of human achievement the plot involves a dystopian united states in which the most creative industrialists scientists and artists respond to a welfare state government by going on strike and retreating to a mountainous hideaway where they build an independent free economy the novels hero and leader of the strike john galt describes the strike as stopping the motor of the world by withdrawing the minds of the individuals most contributing to the nations wealth and achievement with this fictional strike rand intended to illustrate that without the efforts of the rational and productive the economy would collapse and society would fall apart the novel includes elements of romance mystery and science fiction and it contains rands most extensive statement of objectivism in any of her works of fiction a lengthy monologue delivered by galt despite many negative reviews atlas shrugged became an international bestseller in an interview with mike wallace rand declared herself the most creative thinker alive after completing the novel rand fell into a severe depression atlas shrugged was rands last completed work of fiction a turning point in her life it marked the end of rands career as a novelist and the beginning of her role as a popular philosopher in 1958 nathaniel branden established nathaniel branden lectures later incorporated as the nathaniel branden institute nbi to promote rands philosophy collective members gave lectures for nbi and wrote articles for objectivist periodicals that she edited rand later published some of these articles in book form critics including some former nbi students and branden himself have described the culture of nbi as one of intellectual conformity and excessive reverence for rand with some describing nbi or the objectivist movement itself as a cult or religion rand expressed opinions on a wide range of topics from literature and music to sexuality and facial hair and some of her followers mimicked her preferences wearing clothes to match characters from her novels and buying furniture like hers rand was unimpressed with many of the nbi students and held them to strict standards sometimes reacting coldly or angrily to those who disagreed with her however some former nbi students believe the extent of these behaviors has been exaggerated with the problem being concentrated among rands closest followers in new york later years throughout the 1960s and 1970s rand developed and promoted her objectivist philosophy through her nonfiction works and by giving talks to students at institutions such as yale princeton columbia harvard and mit she received an honorary doctorate from lewis clark college in 1963 she also began delivering annual lectures at the ford hall forum responding afterward to questions from the audience during these speeches and qa sessions she often took controversial stances on political and social issues of the day these included supporting abortion rights opposing the vietnam war and the military draft but condemning many draft dodgers as bums supporting israel in the yom kippur war of 1973 against a coalition of arab nations as civilized men fighting savages saying european colonists had the right to develop land taken from american indians and calling homosexuality immoral and disgusting while also advocating the repeal of all laws about it she also endorsed several republican candidates for president of the united states most strongly barry goldwater in 1964 whose candidacy she promoted in several articles for the objectivist newsletter grave marker for rand and her husband at kensico cemetery in valhalla new yorkalta twin gravestone bearing the name frank oconnor on the left and ayn rand oconnor on the right in 1964 nathaniel branden began an affair with the young actress patrecia scott whom he later married nathaniel and barbara branden kept the affair hidden from rand when she learned of it in 1968 though her romantic relationship with branden had already ended rand terminated her relationship with both brandens which led to the closure of nbi rand published an article in the objectivist repudiating nathaniel branden for dishonesty and other irrational behavior in his private life branden later apologized in an interview to every student of objectivism for perpetuating the ayn rand mystique and for contributing to that dreadful atmosphere of intellectual repressiveness that pervades the objectivist movement in subsequent years rand and several more of her closest associates parted company rand underwent surgery for lung cancer in 1974 after decades of heavy smoking in 1976 she retired from writing her newsletter and despite her initial objections allowed evva pryor a social worker from her attorneys office to enroll her in social security and medicare during the late 1970s her activities within the objectivist movement declined especially after the death of her husband on november 9 1979 one of her final projects was work on a nevercompleted television adaptation of atlas shrugged rand died of heart failure on march 6 1982 at her home in new york city and was interred in the kensico cemetery valhalla new york rands funeral was attended by some of her prominent followers including alan greenspan a floral arrangement in the shape of a dollar sign was placed near her casket in her will rand named leonard peikoff to inherit her estate
15,rand called her philosophy objectivism describing its essence as the concept of man as a heroic being with his own happiness as the moral purpose of his life with productive achievement as his noblest activity and reason as his only absolute she considered objectivism a systematic philosophy and laid out positions on metaphysics epistemology ethics political philosophy and aesthetics in metaphysics rand supported philosophical realism and opposed anything she regarded as mysticism or supernaturalism including all forms of religion in epistemology she considered all knowledge to be based on sense perception the validity of which she considered axiomatic and reason which she described as the faculty that identifies and integrates the material provided by mans senses she rejected all claims of nonperceptual or a priori knowledge including instinct intuition revelation or any form of just knowing rand argued that the requirements of cognition determine the objective criteria of conceptualization which she summarized in the form of a philosophical razor known as rands razor it states that concepts are not to be multiplied beyond necessitythe corollary of which is nor are they to be integrated in disregard of necessity in her introduction to objectivist epistemology rand presented a theory of concept formation and rejected the analyticsynthetic dichotomy in ethics rand argued for rational and ethical egoism rational selfinterest as the guiding moral principle she said the individual should exist for his own sake neither sacrificing himself to others nor sacrificing others to himself she referred to egoism as the virtue of selfishness in her book of that title in which she presented her solution to the isought problem by describing a metaethical theory that based morality in the needs of mans survival qua man she condemned ethical altruism as incompatible with the requirements of human life and happiness and held that the initiation of force was evil and irrational writing in atlas shrugged that force and mind are opposites rands political philosophy emphasized individual rights including property rights and she considered laissezfaire capitalism the only moral social system because in her view it was the only system based on the protection of those rights she opposed statism which she understood to include theocracy absolute monarchy nazism fascism communism democratic socialism and dictatorship in the presidential candidates 1968 she argued that fascism and communism were two rival gangs of statism and rejected them as being opposites in imposing a fraudulent choice between a dictatorship of the rich fascism or poor communism in favor of a ruling clique that eliminated the choice of capitalism and freedom she considered fascism a product of the political left as being socialist in being opposed to capitalism rand believed that natural rights should be enforced by a constitutionally limited government although her political views are often classified as conservative or libertarian she preferred the term radical for capitalism she worked with conservatives on political projects but disagreed with them over issues such as religion and ethics she denounced libertarianism which she associated with anarchism she rejected anarchism as a naïve theory based in subjectivism that could only lead to collectivism in practice in aesthetics rand defined art as a selective recreation of reality according to an artists metaphysical valuejudgments according to her art allows philosophical concepts to be presented in a concrete form that can be easily grasped thereby fulfilling a need of human consciousness as a writer the art form rand focused on most closely was literature where she considered romanticism to be the approach that most accurately reflected the existence of human free will she described her own approach to literature as romantic realism rand acknowledged aristotle as her greatest influence and remarked that in the history of philosophy she could only recommend three asaristotle aquinas and ayn rand in a 1959 interview with mike wallace when asked where her philosophy came from she responded out of my own mind with the sole acknowledgement of a debt to aristotle the only philosopher who ever influenced me i devised the rest of my philosophy myself however she also found early inspiration in friedrich nietzsche and scholars have found indications of his influence in early notes from rands journals in passages from the first edition of we the living which rand later revised and in her overall writing style however by the time she wrote the fountainhead rand had turned against nietzsches ideas and the extent of his influence on her even during her early years is disputed among the philosophers rand held in particular disdain was immanuel kant whom she referred to as a monster although philosophers george walsh and fred seddon have argued that she misinterpreted kant and exaggerated their differences rand said her most important contributions to philosophy were her theory of concepts her ethics and her discovery in politics that evilthe violation of rightsconsists of the initiation of force she believed epistemology was a foundational branch of philosophy and considered the advocacy of reason to be the single most significant aspect of her philosophy stating i am not primarily an advocate of capitalism but of egoism and i am not primarily an advocate of egoism but of reason if one recognizes the supremacy of reason and applies it consistently all the rest

18,ancient history in the region of ain hanech saïda province early remnants 200000 bc of hominid occupation in north africa were found neanderthal tool makers produced hand axes in the levalloisian and mousterian styles 43000 bc similar to those in the levant algeria was the site of the highest state of development of middle paleolithic flake tool techniques tools of this era starting about 30000 bc are called aterian after the archeological site of bir el ater south of tebessa the earliest blade industries in north africa are called iberomaurusian located mainly in the oran region this industry appears to have spread throughout the coastal regions of the maghreb between 15000 and 10000 bc neolithic civilization animal domestication and agriculture developed in the saharan and mediterranean maghreb perhaps as early as 11000 bc or as late as between 6000 and 2000 bc this life richly depicted in the tassili najjer paintings predominated in algeria until the classical period the amalgam of peoples of north africa coalesced eventually into a distinct native population that came to be called berbers who are the indigenous peoples of northern africa roman ruins at djémila roman ruins of timgadon the street leading to the local arch of trajan from their principal center of power at carthage the carthaginians expanded and established small settlements along the north african coast by 600 bc a phoenician presence existed at tipasa east of cherchell hippo regius modern annaba and rusicade modern skikda these settlements served as market towns as well as anchorages as carthaginian power grew its impact on the indigenous population increased dramatically berber civilization was already at a stage in which agriculture manufacturing trade and political organization supported several states trade links between carthage and the berbers in the interior grew but territorial expansion also resulted in the enslavement or military recruitment of some berbers and in the extraction of tribute from others numidia along with egypt rome and carthage 200 bce ancient roman theatre in djémila by the early 4th century bc berbers formed the single largest element of the carthaginian army in the revolt of the mercenaries berber soldiers rebelled from 241 to 238 bc after being unpaid following the defeat of carthage in the first punic war they succeeded in obtaining control of much of carthages north african territory and they minted coins bearing the name libyan used in greek to describe natives of north africa the carthaginian state declined because of successive defeats by the romans in the punic wars masinissa c 238148 bc first king of numidia jugurtha c 160104 bc king of numidia in 146 bc the city of carthage was destroyed as carthaginian power waned the influence of berber leaders in the hinterland grew by the 2nd century bc several large but loosely administered berber kingdoms had emerged two of them were established in numidia behind the coastal areas controlled by carthage west of numidia lay mauretania which extended across the moulouya river in modernday morocco to the atlantic ocean the high point of berber civilization unequaled until the coming of the almohads and almoravids more than a millennium later was reached during the reign of masinissa in the 2nd century bc after masinissas death in 148 bc the berber kingdoms were divided and reunited several times masinissas line survived until 24 ad when the remaining berber territory was annexed to the roman empire for several centuries algeria was ruled by the romans who founded many colonies in the region like the rest of north africa algeria was one of the breadbaskets of the empire exporting cereals and other agricultural products saint augustine was the bishop of hippo regius modernday algeria located in the roman province of africa the germanic vandals of geiseric moved into north africa in 429 and by 435 controlled coastal numidia they did not make any significant settlement on the land as they were harassed by local tribes in fact by the time the byzantines arrived lepcis magna was abandoned and the msellata region was occupied by the indigenous laguatan who had been busy facilitating an amazigh political military and cultural revival middle ages mansourah mosque tlemcen after negligible resistance from the locals muslim arabs of the umayyad caliphate conquered algeria in the mid7th century and a large number of the indigenous people converted to the newly founded faith of islam after the fall of the umayyad caliphate numerous local dynasties emerged including the aghlabids almohads abdalwadid zirids rustamids hammadids almoravids and the fatimids during the middle ages north africa was home to many great scholars saints and sovereigns including judah ibn quraysh the first grammarian to suggest the afroasiatic language family the great sufi masters sidi boumediene abu madyan and sidi el houari as well as the emirs abd al mumin and yāghmūrasen it was during this time period that the fatimids or children of fatima daughter of muhammad came to the maghreb these fatimids went on to found a long lasting dynasty stretching across the maghreb hejaz and the levant boasting a secular inner government as well as a powerful army and navy primarily made of arabs and levantians extending from algeria to their capital state of cairo the fatimid caliphate began to collapse when its governors the zirids seceded in order to punish them the fatimids sent the arab banu hilal and banu sulaym against them the resultant war is recounted in the epic tāghribāt in altāghrībāt the amazigh zirid hero khālīfā alzānatī asks daily for duels to defeat the hilalan hero ābu zayd alhilalī and many other arab knights in a string of victories the zirids however were ultimately defeated ushering in an adoption of arab customs and culture the indigenous amazigh tribes however remained largely independent and depending on tribe location and time controlled varying parts of the maghreb at times unifying it as under the fatimids the fatimid islamic state also known as fatimid caliphate made an islamic empire that included north africa sicily palestine jordan lebanon syria egypt the red sea coast of africa tihamah hejaz and yemen caliphates from northern africa traded with the other empires of their time as well as forming part of a confederated support and trade network with other islamic states during the islamic era fatimid caliphate c 9601100 the amazighs historically consisted of several tribes the two main branches were the botr and barnès tribes who were divided into tribes and again into subtribes each region of the maghreb contained several tribes for example sanhadja houara zenata masmouda kutama awarba and berghwata all these tribes made independent territorial decisions several amazigh dynasties emerged during the middle ages in the maghreb and other nearby lands ibn khaldun provides a table summarising the amazigh dynasties of the maghreb region the zirid banu ifran maghrawa almoravid hammadid almohad merinid abdalwadid wattasid meknassa and hafsid dynasties in the early 16th century spain constructed fortified outposts presidios on or near the algerian coast spain took control of few coastal towns like mers el kebir in 1505 oran in 1509 and tlemcen mostaganem and ténès in 1510 in the same year a few merchants of algiers ceded one of the rocky islets in their harbour to spain which built a fort on it the presidios in north africa turned out to be a costly and largely ineffective military endeavour that did not guarantee access for spains merchant fleet the almohad caliphate at its greatest extent c 1212 there reigned in ifriqiya current tunisia a berber family zirid somehow recognising the suzerainty of the fatimid caliph of cairo probably in 1048 the zirid ruler or viceroy elmuizz decided to end this suzerainty the fatimid state was too weak to attempt a punitive expedition the viceroy elmuizz also found another means of revenge between the nile and the red sea were living bedouin tribes expelled from arabia for their disruption and turbulent influence both banu hilal and banu sulaym among others whose presence disrupted farmers in the nile valley since the nomads would often loot the then fatimid vizier devised to relinquish control of the maghreb and obtained the agreement of his sovereign this not only prompted the bedouins to leave but the fatimid treasury even gave them a light expatriation cash allowance whole tribes set off with women children ancestors animals and camping equipment some stopped on the way especially in cyrenaica where they are still one of the essential elements of the settlement but most arrived in ifriqiya by the gabes region the zirid ruler tried to stop this rising tide but each meeting the last under the walls of kairouan his troops were defeated and arabs remained masters of the field the flood was still rising and in 1057 the arabs spread on the high plains of constantine where they gradually choked qalaa of banu hammad as they had done kairouan few decades ago from there they gradually gained the upper algiers and oran plains some were forcibly taken by the almohads in the second half of the 12th century we can say that in the 13th century there were in all of north africa with the exception of the main mountain ranges and certain coastal regions remained entirely berber privateers era the zayyanid kingdom of tlemcen in the fifteenth century and its neighbors hayreddin barbarossa the region of algeria was partially ruled by ottomans for three centuries from 1516 to 1830 in 1516 the turkish privateer brothers aruj and hayreddin barbarossa who operated successfully under the hafsids moved their base of operations to algiers they succeeded in conquering jijel and algiers from the spaniards but eventually assumed control over the city and the surrounding region forcing the previous ruler abu hamo musa iii of the bani ziyad dynasty to flee when aruj was killed in 1518 during his invasion of tlemcen hayreddin succeeded him as military commander of algiers the ottoman sultan gave him the title of beylerbey and a contingent of some 2000 janissaries with the aid of this force hayreddin conquered the whole area between constantine and oran although the city of oran remained in spanish hands until 1791 the next beylerbey was hayreddins son hasan who assumed the position in 1544 until 1587 the area was governed by officers who served terms with no fixed limits subsequently with the institution of a regular ottoman administration governors with the title of pasha ruled for threeyear terms the pasha was assisted by janissaries known in algeria as the ojaq and led by an agha discontent among the ojaq rose in the mid1600s because they were not paid regularly and they repeatedly revolted against the pasha as a result the agha charged the pasha with corruption and incompetence and seized power in 1659 plague had repeatedly struck the cities of north africa algiers lost from 30000 to 50000 inhabitants to the plague in 162021 and suffered high fatalities in 165457 1665 1691 and 174042 in 1671 the taifa rebelled killed the agha and placed one of its own in power the new leader received the title of dey after 1689 the right to select the dey passed to the divan a council of some sixty nobles it was at first dominated by the ojaq but by the 18th century it had become the deys instrument in 1710 the dey persuaded the sultan to recognise him and his successors as regent replacing the pasha in that role although algiers remained a part of the ottoman empire the dey was in effect a constitutional autocrat the dey was elected for a life term but in the 159 years 16711830 that the system survived fourteen of the twentynine deys were assassinated despite usurpation military coups and occasional mob rule the daytoday operation of ottoman government was remarkably orderly although the regency patronised the tribal chieftains it never had the unanimous allegiance of the countryside where heavy taxation frequently provoked unrest autonomous tribal states were tolerated and the regencys authority was seldom applied in the kabylie christian slaves in algiers 1706 the barbary pirates preyed on christian and other nonislamic shipping in the western mediterranean sea the pirates often took the passengers and crew on the ships and sold them or used them as slaves they also did a brisk business in ransoming some of the captives according to robert davis from the 16th to 19th century pirates captured 1 million to 125 million europeans as slaves they often made raids called razzias on european coastal towns to capture christian slaves to sell at slave markets in north africa and the ottoman empire in 1544 hayreddin captured the island of ischia taking 4000 prisoners and enslaved some 9000 inhabitants of lipari almost the entire population in 1551 turgut reis enslaved the entire population of the maltese island of gozo between 5000 and 6000 sending the captives to libya in 1554 pirates sacked vieste in southern italy and took an estimated 7000 captives as slaves in 1558 barbary corsairs captured the town of ciutadella minorca destroyed it slaughtered the inhabitants and took 3000 survivors as slaves to istanbul barbary pirates often attacked the balearic islands and in response the residents built many coastal watchtowers and fortified churches the threat was so severe that residents abandoned the island of formentera between 1609 and 1616 england lost 466 merchant ships to barbary pirates bombardment of algiers by the anglodutch fleet to support the ultimatum to release european slaves august 1816 in july 1627 two pirate ships from algiers sailed as far as iceland raiding and capturing slaves two weeks earlier another pirate ship from salé in morocco had also raided in iceland some of the slaves brought to algiers were later ransomed back to iceland but some chose to stay in algeria in 1629 pirate ships from algeria raided the faroe islands in the 19th century the pirates forged affiliations with caribbean powers paying a licence tax in exchange for safe harbour of their vessels one american slave reported that the algerians had enslaved 130 american seamen in the mediterranean and atlantic from 1785 to 1793 piracy on american vessels in the mediterranean resulted in the united states initiating the first 18011805 and second barbary wars 1815 following those wars algeria was weaker and europeans with an anglodutch fleet commanded by the british lord exmouth attacked algiers after a ninehour bombardment they obtained a treaty from the dey that reaffirmed the conditions imposed by captain later commodore stephen decatur us navy concerning the demands of tributes in addition the dey agreed to end the practice of enslaving christians french colonization 18301962 battle of somah in 1836 under the pretext of a slight to their consul the french invaded and captured algiers in 1830 algerine slave trade and piracy ceased when the french conquered algiers the conquest of algeria by the french took some time and resulted in considerable bloodshed a combination of violence and disease epidemics caused the indigenous algerian population to decline by nearly onethird from 1830 to 1872 historian ben kiernan wrote on the french conquest of algeria by 1875 the french conquest was complete the war had killed approximately 825000 indigenous algerians since 1830 the population of algeria which stood at about 15 million in 1830 reached nearly 11 million in 1960 french policy was predicated on civilising the country during this period a small but influential frenchspeaking indigenous elite was formed made up of berbers mostly kabyles as a consequence french government favored the kabyles about 80 of indigenous schools were constructed for kabyles emir abdelkader algerian leader insurgent against french colonial rule 1865 from 1848 until independence france administered the whole mediterranean region of algeria as an integral part and département of the nation one of frances longestheld overseas territories algeria became a destination for hundreds of thousands of european immigrants who became known as colons and later as piednoirs between 1825 and 1847 50000 french people emigrated to algeria these settlers benefited from the french governments confiscation of communal land from tribal peoples and the application of modern agricultural techniques that increased the amount of arable land many europeans settled in oran and algiers and by the early 20th century they formed a majority of the population in both cities the six historical leaders of the fln rabah bitat mostefa ben boulaïd didouche mourad mohammed boudiaf krim belkacem and larbi ben mhidi during the late 19th and early 20th century the european share was almost a fifth of the population the french government aimed at making algeria an assimilated part of france and this included substantial educational investments especially after 1900 the indigenous cultural and religious resistance heavily opposed this tendency but in contrast to the other colonised countries path in central asia and caucasus algeria kept its individual skills and a relatively humancapital intensive agriculture gradually dissatisfaction among the muslim population which lacked political and economic status in the colonial system gave rise to demands for greater political autonomy and eventually independence from france in may 1945 the uprising against the occupying french forces was suppressed through what is now known as the sétif and guelma massacre tensions between the two population groups came to a head in 1954 when the first violent events of what was later called the algerian war began historians have estimated that between 30000 and 150000 harkis and their dependents were killed by the front de libération nationale fln or by lynch mobs in algeria the fln used hit and run attacks in algeria and france as part of its war and the french conducted severe reprisals the war led to the death of hundreds of thousands of algerians and hundreds of thousands of injuries historians like alistair horne and raymond aron state that the actual number of algerian muslim war dead was far greater than the original fln and official french estimates but was less than the 1 million deaths claimed by the algerian government after independence horne estimated algerian casualties during the span of eight years to be around 700000 the war uprooted more than 2 million algerians the war against french rule concluded in 1962 when algeria gained complete independence following the march 1962 evian agreements and the july 1962 selfdetermination referendum the first three decades of independence 19621991 the number of european piednoirs who fled algeria totaled more than 900000 between 1962 and 1964 the exodus to mainland france accelerated after the oran massacre of 1962 in which hundreds of militants entered european sections of the city and began attacking civilians houari boumediene algerias first president was the front de libération nationale fln leader ahmed ben bella moroccos claim to portions of western algeria led to the sand war in 1963 ben bella was overthrown in 1965 by houari boumediene his former ally and defence minister under ben bella the government had become increasingly socialist and authoritarian boumédienne continued this trend but he relied much more on the army for his support and reduced the sole legal party to a symbolic role he collectivised agriculture and launched a massive industrialization drive oil extraction facilities were nationalised this was especially beneficial to the leadership after the international 1973 oil crisis in the 1960s and 1970s under president houari boumediene algeria pursued a program of industrialization within a statecontrolled socialist economy boumedienes successor chadli bendjedid introduced some liberal economic reforms he promoted a policy of arabisation in algerian society and public life teachers of arabic brought in from other muslim countries spread conventional islamic thought in schools and sowed the seeds of a return to orthodox islam the algerian economy became increasingly dependent on oil leading to hardship when the price collapsed during the 1980s oil glut economic recession caused by the crash in world oil prices resulted in algerian social unrest during the 1980s by the end of the decade bendjedid introduced a multiparty system political parties developed such as the islamic salvation front fis a broad coalition of muslim groups civil war 19912002 and aftermath massacres of over 50 people in 19971998 the armed islamic group gia claimed responsibility for many of them in december 1991 the islamic salvation front dominated the first of two rounds of legislative elections fearing the election of an islamist government the authorities intervened on 11 january 1992 cancelling the elections

taggart transcontinental who often dines with eddie willers in the employees cafeteria and leads eddie to reveal important information about dagny taggart and taggart transcontinental only eddies side of their conversations is given in the novel later in the novel the reader discovers this workers true identity before working for taggart transcontinental galt worked as an engineer for the twentieth century motor company where he secretly invented a generator of usable electric energy from ambient static electricity but abandoned his prototype and his employment when dissatisfied by an easily corrupted novel system of payment this prototype was found by dagny taggart and hank rearden galt himself remains concealed throughout much of the novel in a valley concealed by himself where he unites the most skillful inventors and business leaders under his leadership much of the books third division is given to his broadcast speech which presents the authors philosophy of objectivism

stronger than steel with similar properties to stainless steel he lives in philadelphia with his wife lillian his brother philip and his elderly mother rearden represents a type of selfmade man or

taggarts and himself likewise he is completely loyal to dagny and to taggart transcontinental willers does not possess the creative ability of galts associates but matches them in moral courage and is

to the actress kay ludlow their relationship is kept hidden from the outside world which only knows of ludlow as a retired film star considered a misfit by galts other adherents he views his actions as a means to speed the world along in understanding galts perspective according to barbara branden who was closely associated with rand at the time the book was written there were sections written describing danneskjölds adventures at sea cut from the final published text in a 1974 comment at a lecture ayn rand admitted that danneskjölds name was a tribute to victor hugos novel hans of iceland

wife of hank rearden who dislikes his habits and secretly at first seeks to ruin rearden to prove her own value lillian achieves this when she passes information to james taggart about her husbands

wesley mouch the incompetent and treacherous lobbyist whom hank rearden reluctantly employs in washington who rises to prominence and authority throughout the novel through trading favours and

20,as the field has matured it has debated and arrived at ethical principles aimed at protecting both the subjects of anthropological research as well as the researchers themselves and professional societies have generated codes of ethics anthropologists like other researchers especially historians and scientists engaged in field research have over time assisted state policies and projects especially colonialism some commentators have contended that the discipline grew out of colonialism perhaps was in league with it and derives some of its key notions from it consciously or not see for example gough pels and salemink but cf lewis 2004 that ethnographic work is often ahistorical writing about people as if they were out of time in an ethnographic present johannes fabian time and its other cultural relativism as part of their quest for scientific objectivity presentday anthropologists typically urge cultural relativism which has an influence on all the subfields of anthropology this is the notion that cultures should not be judged by anothers values or viewpoints but be examined dispassionately on their own terms there should be no notions in good anthropology of one culture being better or worse than another culture ethical commitments in anthropology include noticing and documenting genocide infanticide racism mutilation including circumcision and subincision and torture topics like racism slavery and human sacrifice attract anthropological attention and theories ranging from nutritional deficiencies to genes to acculturation have been proposed not to mention theories of colonialism and many others as root causes of mans inhumanity to man to illustrate the depth of an anthropological approach one can take just one of these topics such as racism and find thousands of anthropological references stretching across all the major and minor subfields military involvement anthropologists involvement with the us government in particular has caused bitter controversy within the discipline franz boas publicly objected to us participation in world war i and after the war he published a brief expose and condemnation of the participation of several american archaeologists in espionage in mexico under their cover as scientists but by the 1940s many of boas anthropologist contemporaries were active in the allied war effort against the axis nazi germany fascist italy and imperial japan many served in the armed forces while others worked in intelligence for example office of strategic services and the office of war information at the same time david h prices work on american anthropology during the cold war provides detailed accounts of the pursuit and dismissal of several anthropologists from their jobs for communist sympathies attempts to accuse anthropologists of complicity with the cia and government intelligence activities during the vietnam war years have turned up surprisingly little many anthropologists students and teachers were active in the antiwar movement numerous resolutions condemning the war in all its aspects were passed overwhelmingly at the annual meetings of the american anthropological association aaa professional anthropological bodies often object to the use of anthropology for the benefit of the state their codes of ethics or statements may proscribe anthropologists from giving secret briefings the association of social anthropologists of the uk and commonwealth asa has called certain scholarship ethically dangerous the aaas current statement of professional responsibility clearly states that in relation with their own government and with host governments no secret research no secret reports or debriefings of any kind should be agreed to or given anthropologists along with other social scientists are working with the us military as part of the us armys strategy in afghanistan the christian science monitor reports that counterinsurgency efforts focus on better grasping and meeting local needs in afghanistan under the human terrain system hts program in addition hts teams are working with the us military in iraq in 2009 the american anthropological associations commission on the engagement of anthropology with the us security and intelligence communities released its final report concluding in part that when ethnographic investigation is determined by military missions not subject to external review where data collection occurs in the context of war integrated into the goals of counterinsurgency and in a potentially coercive environment all characteristic factors of the hts concept and its application it can no longer be considered a legitimate professional exercise of anthropology in summary while we stress that constructive engagement between anthropology and the military is possible ceaussic suggests that the aaa emphasize the incompatibility of hts with disciplinary ethics and practice for job seekers and that it further recognize the problem of allowing hts to define the meaning of anthropology within dod
20,before wwii british social anthropology and american cultural anthropology were still distinct traditions after the war enough british and american anthropologists borrowed ideas and methodological approaches from one another that some began to speak of them collectively as sociocultural anthropology basic trends there are several characteristics that tend to unite anthropological work one of the central characteristics is that anthropology tends to provide a comparatively more holistic account of phenomena and tends to be highly empirical the quest for holism leads most anthropologists to study a particular place problem or phenomenon in detail using a variety of methods over a more extensive period than normal in many parts of academia in the 1990s and 2000s decade calls for clarification of what constitutes a culture of how an observer knows where his or her own culture ends and another begins and other crucial topics in writing anthropology were heard these dynamic relationships between what can be observed on the ground as opposed to what can be observed by compiling many local observations remain fundamental in any kind of anthropology whether cultural biological linguistic or archaeological biological anthropologists are interested in both human variation and in the possibility of human universals behaviors ideas or concepts shared by virtually all human cultures they use many different methods of study but modern population genetics participant observation and other techniques often take anthropologists into the field which means traveling to a community in its own setting to do something called fieldwork on the biological or physical side human measurements genetic samples nutritional data may be gathered and published as articles or monographs along with dividing up their project by theoretical emphasis anthropologists typically divide the world up into relevant time periods and geographic regions human time on earth is divided up into relevant cultural traditions based on material such as the paleolithic and the neolithic of particular use in archaeology further cultural subdivisions according to tool types such as olduwan or mousterian or levalloisian help archaeologists and other anthropologists in understanding major trends in the human past anthropologists and geographers share approaches to culture regions as well since mapping cultures is central to both sciences by making comparisons across cultural traditions timebased and cultural regions spacebased anthropologists have developed various kinds of comparative method a central part of their science commonalities between fields because anthropology developed from so many different enterprises see history of anthropology including but not limited to fossilhunting exploring documentary filmmaking paleontology primatology antiquity dealings and curatorship philology etymology genetics regional analysis ethnology history philosophy and religious studies it is difficult to characterize the entire field in a brief article although attempts to write histories of the entire field have been made some authors argue that anthropology originated and developed as the study of other cultures both in terms of time past societies and space noneuropeannonwestern societies for example the classic of urban anthropology ulf hannerz in the introduction to his seminal exploring the city inquiries toward an urban anthropology mentions that the third world had habitually received most of attention anthropologists who traditionally specialized in other cultures looked for them far away and started to look across the tracks only in late 1960s now there exist many works focusing on peoples and topics very close to the authors home it is also argued that other fields of study like history and sociology on the contrary focus disproportionately on the west in france the study of western societies has been traditionally left to sociologists but this is increasingly changing starting in the 1970s from scholars like isac chiva and journals like terrain fieldwork and developing with the center founded by marc augé le centre danthropologie des mondes contemporains the anthropological research center of contemporary societies since the 1980s it has become common for social and cultural anthropologists to set ethnographic research in the north atlantic region frequently examining the connections between locations rather than limiting research to a single locale there has also been a related shift toward broadening the focus beyond the daily life of ordinary people increasingly research is set in settings such as scientific laboratories social movements governmental and nongovernmental organizations and businesses
20,the abstract noun anthropology is first attested in reference to history its present use first appeared in renaissance germany in the works of magnus hundt and otto casmann their new latin derived from the combining forms of the greek words ánthrōpos human and lógos study its adjectival form appeared in the works of aristotle it began to be used in english possibly via french by the early 18th century through the 19th century in 1647 the bartholins founders of the university of copenhagen defined as follows anthropology that is to say the science that treats of man is divided ordinarily and with reason into anatomy which considers the body and the parts and psychology which speaks of the soul sporadic use of the term for some of the subject matter occurred subsequently such as the use by étienne serres in 1839 to describe the natural history or paleontology of man based on comparative anatomy and the creation of a chair in anthropology and ethnography in 1850 at the national museum of natural history france by jean louis armand de quatrefages de bréau various shortlived organizations of anthropologists had already been formed the société ethnologique de paris the first to use ethnology was formed in 1839 its members were primarily antislavery activists when slavery was abolished in france in 1848 the société was abandoned meanwhile the ethnological society of new york currently the american ethnological society was founded on its model in 1842 as well as the ethnological society of london in 1843 a breakaway group of the aborigines protection society these anthropologists of the times were liberal antislavery and prohumanrights activists they maintained international connections anthropology and many other current fields are the intellectual results of the comparative methods developed in the earlier 19th century theorists in such diverse fields as anatomy linguistics and ethnology making featurebyfeature comparisons of their subject matters were beginning to suspect that similarities between animals languages and folkways were the result of processes or laws unknown to them then for them the publication of charles darwins on the origin of species was the epiphany of everything they had begun to suspect darwin himself arrived at his conclusions through comparison of species he had seen in agronomy and in the wild darwin and wallace unveiled evolution in the late 1850s there was an immediate rush to bring it into the social sciences paul broca in paris was in the process of breaking away from the société de biologie to form the first of the explicitly anthropological societies the société danthropologie de paris meeting for the first time in paris in 1859 when he read darwin he became an immediate convert to transformisme as the french called evolutionism his definition now became the study of the human group considered as a whole in its details and in relation to the rest of nature broca being what today would be called a neurosurgeon had taken an interest in the pathology of speech he wanted to localize the difference between man and the other animals which appeared to reside in speech he discovered the speech center of the human brain today called brocas area after him his interest was mainly in biological anthropology but a german philosopher specializing in psychology theodor waitz took up the theme of general and social anthropology in his sixvolume work entitled die anthropologie der naturvölker 18591864 the title was soon translated as the anthropology of primitive peoples the last two volumes were published posthumously waitz defined anthropology as the science of the nature of man by nature he meant matter animated by the divine breath ie he was an animist following brocas lead waitz points out that anthropology is a new field which would gather material from other fields but would differ from them in the use of comparative anatomy physiology and psychology to differentiate man from the animals nearest to him he stresses that the data of comparison must be empirical gathered by experimentation the history of civilization as well as ethnology are to be brought into the comparison it is to be presumed fundamentally that the species man is a unity and that the same laws of thought are applicable to all men waitz was influential among the british ethnologists in 1863 the explorer richard francis burton and the speech therapist james hunt broke away from the ethnological society of london to form the anthropological society of london which henceforward would follow the path of the new anthropology rather than just ethnology it was the 2nd society dedicated to general anthropology in existence representatives from the french société were present though not broca in his keynote address printed in the first volume of its new publication the anthropological review hunt stressed the work of waitz adopting his definitions as a standard among the first associates were the young edward burnett tylor inventor of cultural anthropology and his brother alfred tylor a geologist previously edward had referred to himself as an ethnologist subsequently an anthropologist similar organizations in other countries followed the anthropological society of madrid 1865 the american anthropological association in 1902 the anthropological society of vienna 1870 the italian society of anthropology and ethnology 1871 and many others subsequently the majority of these were evolutionist one notable exception was the berlin society for anthropology ethnology and prehistory 1869 founded by rudolph virchow known for his vituperative attacks on the evolutionists not religious himself he insisted that darwins conclusions lacked empirical foundation during the last three decades of the 19th century a proliferation of anthropological societies and associations occurred most independent most publishing their own journals and all international in membership and association the major theorists belonged to these organizations they supported the gradual osmosis of anthropology curricula into the major institutions of higher learning by 1898 the american association for the advancement of science was able to report that 48 educational institutions in 13 countries had some curriculum in anthropology none of the 75 faculty members were under a department named anthropology 20th and 21st centuries this meagre statistic expanded in the 20th century to comprise anthropology departments in the majority of the worlds higher educational institutions many thousands in number anthropology has diversified from a few major subdivisions to dozens more practical anthropology the use of anthropological knowledge and technique to solve specific problems has arrived for example the presence of buried victims might stimulate the use of a forensic archaeologist to recreate the final scene organization has reached global level for example the world council of anthropological associations wcaa a network of national regional and international associations that aims to promote worldwide communication and cooperation in anthropology currently contains members from about three dozen nations since the work of franz boas and bronisław malinowski in the late 19th and early 20th centuries social anthropology in great britain and cultural anthropology in the us have been distinguished from other social sciences by its emphasis on crosscultural comparisons longterm indepth examination of context and the importance it places on participantobservation or experiential immersion in the area of research cultural anthropology in particular has emphasized cultural relativism holism and the use of findings to frame cultural critiques this has been particularly prominent in the united states from boas arguments against 19thcentury racial ideology through margaret meads advocacy for gender equality and sexual liberation to current criticisms of postcolonial oppression and promotion of multiculturalism ethnography is one of its primary research designs as well as the text that is generated from anthropological fieldwork in great britain and the commonwealth countries the british tradition of social anthropology tends to dominate in the united states anthropology has traditionally been divided into the four field approach developed by franz boas in the early 20th century biological or physical anthropology social cultural or sociocultural anthropology and archaeology plus anthropological linguistics these fields frequently overlap but tend to use different methodologies and techniques european countries with overseas colonies tended to practice more ethnology a term coined and defined by adam f kollár in 1783 it is sometimes referred to as sociocultural anthropology in the parts of the world that were influenced by the european tradition
20,anthropology is a global discipline involving humanities social sciences and natural sciences anthropology builds upon knowledge from natural sciences including the discoveries about the origin and evolution of homo sapiens human physical traits human behavior the variations among different groups of humans how the evolutionary past of homo sapiens has influenced its social organization and culture and from social sciences including the organization of human social and cultural relations institutions social conflicts etc early anthropology originated in classical greece and persia and studied and tried to understand observable cultural diversity as such anthropology has been central in the development of several new late 20th century interdisciplinary fields such as cognitive science global studies and various ethnic studies according to clifford geertz sociocultural anthropology has been heavily influenced by structuralist and postmodern theories as well as a shift toward the analysis of modern societies during the 1970s and 1990s there was an epistemological shift away from the positivist traditions that had largely informed the discipline during this shift enduring questions about the nature and production of knowledge came to occupy a central place in cultural and social anthropology in contrast archaeology and biological anthropology remained largely positivist due to this difference in epistemology the four subfields of anthropology have lacked cohesion over the last several decades sociocultural sociocultural anthropology draws together the principle axes of cultural anthropology and social anthropology cultural anthropology is the comparative study of the manifold ways in which people make sense of the world around them while social anthropology is the study of the relationships among persons and groups cultural anthropology is more related to philosophy literature and the arts how ones culture affects experience for self and group contributing to more complete understanding of the peoples knowledge customs and institutions while social anthropology is more related to sociology and history in that it helps develop understanding of social structures typically of others and other populations such as minorities subgroups dissidents etc there is no hardandfast distinction between them and these categories overlap to a considerable degree inquiry in sociocultural anthropology is guided in part by cultural relativism the attempt to understand other societies in terms of their own cultural symbols and values accepting other cultures in their own terms moderates reductionism in crosscultural comparison this project is often accommodated in the field of ethnography ethnography can refer to both a methodology and the product of ethnographic research ie an ethnographic monograph as methodology ethnography is based upon longterm fieldwork within a community or other research site participant observation is one of the foundational methods of social and cultural anthropology ethnology involves the systematic comparison of different cultures the process of participantobservation can be especially helpful to understanding a culture from an emic conceptual vs etic or technical point of view the study of kinship and social organization is a central focus of sociocultural anthropology as kinship is a human universal sociocultural anthropology also covers economic and political organization law and conflict resolution patterns of consumption and exchange material culture technology infrastructure gender relations ethnicity childrearing and socialization religion myth symbols values etiquette worldview sports music nutrition recreation games food festivals and language which is also the object of study in linguistic anthropology comparison across cultures is a key element of method in sociocultural anthropology including the industrialized and deindustrialized west cultures

anthropologists can help identify skeletonized human remains such as these found lying in scrub in western australia c 19001910 biological anthropology and physical anthropology are synonymous terms to describe anthropological research focused on the study of humans and nonhuman primates in their biological evolutionary and demographic dimensions it examines the biological and social factors that have affected the evolution of humans and other primates and that generate maintain or change contemporary genetic and physiological variation archaeological excavations at the 3800yearold edgewater park site iowa archaeology is the study of the human past through its material remains artifacts faunal remains and human altered landscapes are evidence of the cultural and material lives of past societies archaeologists examine these material remains in order to deduce patterns of past human behavior and cultural practices ethnoarchaeology is a type of archaeology that studies the practices and material remains of living human groups in order to gain a better understanding of the evidence left behind by past human groups who are presumed to have lived in similar ways rosetta stone was an example of ancient communication linguistic linguistic anthropology also called anthropological linguistics seeks to understand the processes of human communications verbal and nonverbal variation in language across time and space the social uses of language and the relationship between language and culture it is the branch of anthropology that brings linguistic methods to bear on anthropological problems linking the analysis of linguistic forms and processes to the interpretation of sociocultural processes linguistic anthropologists often draw on related fields including sociolinguistics pragmatics cognitive linguistics semiotics discourse analysis and narrative analysis

20,art media music dance and film art one of the central problems in the anthropology of art concerns the universality of art as a cultural phenomenon several anthropologists have noted that the western categories of painting sculpture or literature conceived as independent artistic activities do not exist or exist in a significantly different form in most nonwestern contexts to surmount this difficulty anthropologists of art have focused on formal features in objects which without exclusively being artistic have certain evident aesthetic qualities boas primitive art claude lévistrauss the way of the masks 1982 or geertzs art as cultural system 1983 are some examples in this trend to transform the anthropology of art into an anthropology of culturally specific aesthetics media a punu tribe mask gabon central africa media anthropology also known as anthropology of media or mass media emphasizes ethnographic studies as a means of understanding producers audiences and other cultural and social aspects of mass media the types of ethnographic contexts explored range from contexts of media production eg ethnographies of newsrooms in newspapers journalists in the field film production to contexts of media reception following audiences in their everyday responses to media other types include cyber anthropology a relatively new area of internet research as well as ethnographies of other areas of research which happen to involve media such as development work social movements or health education this is in addition to many classic ethnographic contexts where media such as radio the press new media and television have started to make their presences felt since the early 1990s music ethnomusicology is an academic field encompassing various approaches to the study of music broadly defined that emphasize its cultural social material cognitive biological and other dimensions or contexts instead of or in addition to its isolated sound component or any particular repertoire visual visual anthropology is concerned in part with the study and production of ethnographic photography film and since the mid1990s new media while the term is sometimes used interchangeably with ethnographic film visual anthropology also encompasses the anthropological study of visual representation including areas such as performance museums art and the production and reception of mass media visual representations from all cultures such as sandpaintings tattoos sculptures and reliefs cave paintings scrimshaw jewelry hieroglyphics paintings and photographs are included in the focus of visual anthropology economic political economic applied and development economic economic anthropology attempts to explain human economic behavior in its widest historic geographic and cultural scope it has a complex relationship with the discipline of economics of which it is highly critical its origins as a subfield of anthropology begin with the polishbritish founder of anthropology bronislaw malinowski and his french compatriot marcel mauss on the nature of giftgiving exchange or reciprocity as an alternative to market exchange economic anthropology remains for the most part focused upon exchange the school of thought derived from marx and known as political economy focuses on production in contrast economic anthropologists have abandoned the primitivist niche they were relegated to by economists and have now turned to examine corporations banks and the global financial system from an anthropological perspective political economy political economy in anthropology is the application of the theories and methods of historical materialism to the traditional concerns of anthropology including but not limited to noncapitalist societies political economy introduced questions of history and colonialism to ahistorical anthropological theories of social structure and culture three main areas of interest rapidly developed the first of these areas was concerned with the precapitalist societies that were subject to evolutionary tribal stereotypes sahlins work on huntergatherers as the original affluent society did much to dissipate that image the second area was concerned with the vast majority of the worlds population at the time the peasantry many of whom were involved in complex revolutionary wars such as in vietnam the third area was on colonialism imperialism and the creation of the capitalist worldsystem more recently these political economists have more directly addressed issues of industrial and postindustrial capitalism around the world applied applied anthropology refers to the application of the method and theory of anthropology to the analysis and solution of practical problems it is a complex of related researchbased instrumental methods which produce change or stability in specific cultural systems through the provision of data initiation of direct action andor the formulation of policy more simply applied anthropology is the practical side of anthropological research it includes researcher involvement and activism within the participating community it is closely related to development anthropology distinct from the more critical anthropology of development development anthropology of development tends to view development from a critical perspective the kind of issues addressed and implications for the approach simply involve pondering why if a key development goal is to alleviate poverty is poverty increasing why is there such a gap between plans and outcomes why are those working in development so willing to disregard history and the lessons it might offer why is development so externally driven rather than having an internal basis in short why does so much planned development fail kinship feminism gender and sexuality kinship kinship can refer both to the study of the patterns of social relationships in one or more human cultures or it can refer to the patterns of social relationships themselves over its history anthropology has developed a number of related concepts and terms such as descent descent groups lineages affines cognates and even fictive kinship broadly kinship patterns may be considered to include people related both by descent ones social relations during development and also relatives by marriage feminist feminist anthropology is a four field approach to anthropology archeological biological cultural linguistic that seeks to reduce male bias in research findings anthropological hiring practices and the scholarly production of knowledge anthropology engages often with feminists from nonwestern traditions whose perspectives and experiences can differ from those of white european and american feminists historically such peripheral perspectives have sometimes been marginalized and regarded as less valid or important than knowledge from the western world feminist anthropologists have claimed that their research helps to correct this systematic bias in mainstream feminist theory feminist anthropologists are centrally concerned with the construction of gender across societies feminist anthropology is inclusive of birth anthropology as a specialization the first africanamerican female anthropologist and caribbeanist is said to be vera mae green who studied ethnic and family relations in the caribbean as well as the united states and thereby tried to improve the way black life experiences and culture were studied medical nutritional psychological cognitive and transpersonal medical medical anthropology is an interdisciplinary field which studies human health and disease health care systems and biocultural adaptation it is believed that william caudell was the first to discover the field of medical anthropology currently research in medical anthropology is one of the main growth areas in the field of anthropology as a whole it focuses on the following six basic fields the development of systems of medical knowledge and medical care the patientphysician relationship the integration of alternative medical systems in culturally diverse environments the interaction of social environmental and biological factors which influence health and illness both in the individual and the community as a whole the critical analysis of interaction between psychiatric services and migrant populations critical ethnopsychiatry beneduce 2004 2007 the impact of biomedicine and biomedical technologies in nonwestern settings other subjects that have become central to medical anthropology worldwide are violence and social suffering farmer 1999 2003 beneduce 2010 as well as other issues that involve physical and psychological harm and suffering that are not a result of illness on the other hand there are fields that intersect with medical anthropology in terms of research methodology and theoretical production such as cultural psychiatry and transcultural psychiatry or ethnopsychiatry nutritional nutritional anthropology is a synthetic concept that deals with the interplay between economic systems nutritional status and food security and how changes in the former affect the latter if economic and environmental changes in a community affect access to food food security and dietary health then this interplay between culture and biology is in turn connected to broader historical and economic trends associated with globalization nutritional status affects overall health status work performance potential and the overall potential for economic development either in terms of human development or traditional western models for any given group of people psychological psychological anthropology is an interdisciplinary subfield of anthropology that studies the interaction of cultural and mental processes this subfield tends to focus on ways in which humans development and enculturation within a particular cultural groupwith its own history language practices and conceptual categoriesshape processes of human cognition emotion perception motivation and mental health it also examines how the understanding of cognition emotion motivation and similar psychological processes inform or constrain our models of cultural and social processes cognitive cognitive anthropology seeks to explain patterns of shared knowledge cultural innovation and transmission over time and space using the methods and theories of the cognitive sciences especially experimental psychology and evolutionary biology often through close collaboration with historians ethnographers archaeologists linguists musicologists and other specialists engaged in the description and interpretation of cultural forms cognitive anthropology is concerned with what people from different groups know and how that implicit knowledge changes the way people perceive and relate to the world around them transpersonal transpersonal anthropology studies the relationship between altered states of consciousness and culture as with transpersonal psychology the field is much concerned with altered states of consciousness asc and transpersonal experience however the field differs from mainstream transpersonal psychology in taking more cognizance of crosscultural issuesfor instance the roles of myth ritual diet and texts in evoking and interpreting extraordinary experiences political and legal political political anthropology concerns the structure of political systems looked at from the basis of the structure of societies political anthropology developed as a discipline concerned primarily with politics in stateless societies a new development started from the 1960s and is still unfolding anthropologists started increasingly to study more complex social settings in which the presence of states bureaucracies and markets entered both ethnographic accounts and analysis of local phenomena the turn towards complex societies meant that political themes were taken up at two main levels first of all anthropologists continued to study political organization and political phenomena that lay outside the stateregulated sphere as in patronclient relations or tribal political organization second of all anthropologists slowly started to develop a disciplinary concern with states and their institutions and of course on the relationship between formal and informal political institutions an anthropology of the state developed and it is a most thriving field today geertz comparative work on negara the balinese state is an early famous example legal legal anthropology or anthropology of law specializes in the crosscultural study of social ordering earlier legal anthropological research often focused more narrowly on conflict management crime sanctions or formal regulation more recent applications include issues such as human rights legal pluralism and political uprisings public public anthropology was created by robert borofsky a professor at hawaii pacific university to demonstrate the ability of anthropology and anthropologists to effectively address problems beyond the discipline illuminating larger social issues of our times as well as encouraging broad public conversations about them with the explicit goal of fostering social change borofsky 2004 nature science and technology cyborg cyborg anthropology originated as a subfocus group within the american anthropological associations annual meeting in 1993 the subgroup was very closely related to sts and the society for the social studies of science donna haraways 1985 cyborg manifesto could be considered the founding document of cyborg anthropology by first exploring the philosophical and sociological ramifications of the term cyborg anthropology studies humankind and its relations with the technological systems it has built specifically modern technological systems that have reflexively shaped notions of what it means to be human beings digital digital anthropology is the study of the relationship between humans and digitalera technology and extends to various areas where anthropology and technology intersect it is sometimes grouped with sociocultural anthropology and sometimes considered part of material culture the field is new and thus has a variety of names with a variety of emphases these include technoanthropology digital ethnography cyberanthropology and virtual anthropology ecological ecological anthropology is defined as the study of cultural adaptations to environments the subfield is also defined as the study of relationships between a population of humans and their biophysical environment the focus of its research concerns how cultural beliefs and practices helped human populations adapt to their environments and how their environment across space and time the contemporary perspective of environmental anthropology and arguably at least the backdrop if not the focus of most of the ethnographies and cultural fieldworks of today is political ecology many characterize this new perspective as more informed with culture politics and power globalization localized issues century anthropology and more the focus and data interpretation is often used for arguments foragainst or creation of policy and to prevent corporate exploitation and damage of land often the observer has become an active part of the struggle either directly organizing participation or indirectly articles documentaries books ethnographies such is the case with environmental justice advocate melissa checker and her relationship with the people of hyde park historical ethnohistory is the study of ethnographic cultures and indigenous customs by examining historical records it is also the study of the history of various ethnic groups that may or may not exist today ethnohistory uses both historical and ethnographic data as its foundation its historical methods and materials go beyond the standard use of documents and manuscripts practitioners recognize the utility of such source material as maps music paintings photography folklore oral tradition site exploration archaeological materials museum collections enduring customs language and place names religion the anthropology of religion involves the study of religious institutions in relation to other social institutions and the comparison of religious beliefs and practices across cultures modern anthropology assumes that there is complete continuity between magical thinking and religion and that every religion is a cultural product created by the human community that worships it urban urban anthropology is concerned with issues of urbanization poverty and neoliberalism ulf hannerz quotes a 1960s remark that traditional anthropologists were a notoriously agoraphobic lot antiurban by definition various social processes in the western world as well as in the third world the latter being the habitual focus of attention of anthropologists brought the attention of specialists in other cultures closer to their homes there are two main approaches to urban anthropology examining the types of cities or examining the social issues within the cities these two methods are overlapping and dependent of each other by defining different types of cities one would use social factors as well as economic and political factors to categorize the cities by directly looking at the different social issues one would also be studying how they affect the dynamic of the city
20,anthrozoology anthrozoology also known as humananimal studies is the study of interaction between living things it is a burgeoning interdisciplinary field that overlaps with a number of other disciplines including anthropology ethology medicine psychology veterinary medicine and zoology a major focus of anthrozoologic research is the quantifying of the positive effects of humananimal relationships on either party and the study of their interactions it includes scholars from a diverse range of fields including anthropology sociology biology and philosophy biocultural biocultural anthropology is the scientific exploration of the relationships between human biology and culture physical anthropologists throughout the first half of the 20th century viewed this relationship from a racial perspective that is from the assumption that typological human biological differences lead to cultural differences after world war ii the emphasis began to shift toward an effort to explore the role culture plays in shaping human biology evolutionary evolutionary anthropology is the interdisciplinary study of the evolution of human physiology and human behaviour and the relation between hominins and nonhominin primates evolutionary anthropology is based in natural science and social science combining the human development with socioeconomic factors evolutionary anthropology is concerned with both biological and cultural evolution of humans past and present it is based on a scientific approach and brings together fields such as archaeology behavioral ecology psychology primatology and genetics it is a dynamic and interdisciplinary field drawing on many lines of evidence to understand the human experience past and present forensic forensic anthropology is the application of the science of physical anthropology and human osteology in a legal setting most often in criminal cases where the victims remains are in the advanced stages of decomposition a forensic anthropologist can assist in the identification of deceased individuals whose remains are decomposed burned mutilated or otherwise unrecognizable the adjective forensic refers to the application of this subfield of science to a court of law palaeoanthropology paleoanthropology combines the disciplines of paleontology and physical anthropology it is the study of ancient humans as found in fossil hominid evidence such as petrifacted bones and footprints

21,agricultural science began with gregor mendels genetic work but in modern terms might be better dated from the chemical fertilizer outputs of plant physiological understanding in 18thcentury germany in the united states a scientific revolution in agriculture began with the hatch act of 1887 which used the term agricultural science the hatch act was driven by farmers interest in knowing the constituents of early artificial fertilizer the smithhughes act of 1917 shifted agricultural education back to its vocational roots but the scientific foundation had been built after 1906 public expenditures on agricultural research in the us exceeded private expenditures for the next 44 years intensification of agriculture since the 1960s in developed and developing countries often referred to as the green revolution was closely tied to progress made in selecting and improving crops and animals for high productivity as well as to developing additional inputs such as artificial fertilizers and phytosanitary products as the oldest and largest human intervention in nature the environmental impact of agriculture in general and more recently intensive agriculture industrial development and population growth have raised many questions among agricultural scientists and have led to the development and emergence of new fields these include technological fields that assume the solution to technological problems lies in better technology such as integrated pest management waste treatment technologies landscape architecture genomics and agricultural philosophy fields that include references to food production as something essentially different from nonessential economic goods in fact the interaction between these two approaches provide a fertile field for deeper understanding in agricultural science new technologies such as biotechnology and computer science for data processing and storage and technological advances have made it possible to develop new research fields including genetic engineering agrophysics improved statistical analysis and precision farming balancing these as above are the natural and human sciences of agricultural science that seek to understand the humannature interactions of traditional agriculture including interaction of religion and agriculture and the nonmaterial components of agricultural production systems
21,with the exception of theoretical agronomy research in agronomy more than in any other field is strongly related to local areas it can be considered a science of ecoregions because it is closely linked to soil properties and climate which are never exactly the same from one place to another many people think an agricultural production system relying on local weather soil characteristics and specific crops has to be studied locally others feel a need to know and understand production systems in as many areas as possible and the human dimension of interaction with nature
21,agriculture sciences seek to feed the worlds population while preventing biosafety problems that may affect human health and the environment this requires promoting good management of natural resources and respect for the environment and increasingly concern for the psychological wellbeing of all concerned in the food production and consumption system economic environmental and social aspects of agriculture sciences are subjects of ongoing debate recent crises such as avian influenza mad cow disease and issues such as the use of genetically modified organisms illustrate the complexity and importance of this debate

22,alchemy covers several philosophical traditions spanning some four millennia and three continents these traditions general penchant for cryptic and symbolic language makes it hard to trace their mutual influences and genetic relationships one can distinguish at least three major strands which appear to be largely independent at least in their earlier stages chinese alchemy centered in china and its zone of cultural influence indian alchemy centered on the indian subcontinent and western alchemy which occurred around the mediterranean and whose center has shifted over the millennia from grecoroman egypt to the islamic world and finally medieval europe chinese alchemy was closely connected to taoism and indian alchemy with the dharmic faiths whereas western alchemy developed its own philosophical system that was largely independent of but influenced by various western religions it is still an open question whether these three strands share a common origin or to what extent they influenced each other hellenistic egypt zosimos from marcelin berthelot collection des anciens alchimistes grecs 3 vol paris 18871888 the start of western alchemy may generally be traced to ancient and hellenistic egypt where the city of alexandria was a center of alchemical knowledge and retained its preeminence through most of the greek and roman periods here elements of technology religion mythology and hellenistic philosophy each with their own much longer histories combined to form the earliest known records of alchemy in the west zosimos of panopolis wrote the oldest known books on alchemy while mary the jewess is credited as being the first nonfictitious western alchemist they wrote in greek and lived in egypt under roman rule mythology zosimos of panopolis asserted that alchemy dated back to pharaonic egypt where it was the domain of the priestly class though there is little to no evidence for his assertion alchemical writers used classical figures from greek roman and egyptian mythology to illuminate their works and allegorize alchemical transmutation these included the pantheon of gods related to the classical planets isis osiris jason and many others the central figure in the mythology of alchemy is hermes trismegistus or thricegreat hermes his name is derived from the god thoth and his greek counterpart hermes hermes and his caduceus or serpentstaff were among alchemys principal symbols according to clement of alexandria he wrote what were called the fortytwo books of hermes covering all fields of knowledge the hermetica of thricegreat hermes is generally understood to form the basis for western alchemical philosophy and practice called the hermetic philosophy by its early practitioners these writings were collected in the first centuries of the common era technology the dawn of western alchemy is sometimes associated with that of metallurgy extending back to 3500 many writings were lost when the emperor diocletian ordered the burning of alchemical books after suppressing a revolt in alexandria 292 few original egyptian documents on alchemy have survived most notable among them the stockholm papyrus and the leyden papyrus x dating from 300500 they contained recipes for dyeing and making artificial gemstones cleaning and fabricating pearls and manufacturing of imitation gold and silver these writings lack the mystical philosophical elements of alchemy but do contain the works of bolus of mendes or pseudodemocritus which aligned these recipes with theoretical knowledge of astrology and the classical elements between the time of bolus and zosimos the change took place that transformed this metallurgy into a hermetic art philosophy alexandria acted as a melting pot for philosophies of pythagoreanism platonism stoicism and gnosticism which formed the origin of alchemys character an important example of alchemys roots in greek philosophy originated by empedocles and developed by aristotle was that all things in the universe were formed from only four elements earth air water and fire according to aristotle each element had a sphere to which it belonged and to which it would return if left undisturbed the four elements of the greek were mostly qualitative aspects of matter not quantitative as our modern elements are true alchemy never regarded earth air water and fire as corporeal or chemical substances in the presentday sense of the word the four elements are simply the primary and most general qualities by means of which the amorphous and purely quantitative substance of all bodies first reveals itself in differentiated form later alchemists extensively developed the mystical aspects of this concept alchemy coexisted alongside emerging christianity lactantius believed hermes trismegistus had prophesied its birth st augustine later affirmed this in the 4th 5th centuries but also condemned trismegistus for idolatry examples of pagan christian and jewish alchemists can be found during this period most of the grecoroman alchemists preceding zosimos are known only by pseudonyms such as moses isis cleopatra democritus and ostanes others authors such as komarios and chymes we only know through fragments of text after 400 greek alchemical writers occupied themselves solely in commenting on the works of these predecessors by the middle of the 7th century alchemy was almost an entirely mystical discipline it was at that time that khalid ibn yazid sparked its migration from alexandria to the islamic world facilitating the translation and preservation of greek alchemical texts in the 8th and 9th centuries india the vedas describe a connection between eternal life and gold the use of mercury for alchemy is first documented in the 3rd or 4thcentury arthashastra buddhist texts from the 2nd to 5th centuries mention the transmutation of base metals to gold greek alchemy may have been introduced to ancient india through the invasions of alexander the great in 325 and kingdoms that were culturally influenced by the greeks like gandhāra although hard evidence for this is lacking the 11thcentury persian chemist and physician abū rayhān bīrūnī who visited gujarat as part of the court of mahmud of ghazni reported that they the goals of alchemy in india included the creation of a divine body sanskrit divyadeham and immortality while still embodied sanskrit jīvanmukti sanskrit alchemical texts include much material on the manipulation of mercury and sulphur that are homologized with the semen of the god śiva and the menstrual blood of the goddess devī some early alchemical writings seem to have their origins in the kaula tantric schools associated to the teachings of the personality of matsyendranath other early writings are found in the jaina medical treatise kalyāṇakārakam of ugrāditya written in south india in the early 9th century two famous early indian alchemical authors were nāgārjuna siddha and nityanātha siddha nāgārjuna siddha was a buddhist monk his book rasendramangalam is an example of indian alchemy and medicine nityanātha siddha wrote rasaratnākara also a highly influential work in sanskrit rasa translates to mercury and nāgārjuna siddha was said to have developed a method of converting mercury into gold reliable scholarship on indian alchemy has been advanced in a major way by the publication of the alchemical body by david gordon white trustworthy scholarship on indian alchemy must now take the findings of this work into account an important modern bibliography on indian alchemical studies has also been provided by david gordon white at oxford bibliographies online the contents of 39 sanskrit alchemical treatises have been analysed in detail in g jan meulenbelds history of indian medical literature the discussion of these works in himl gives a summary of the contents of each work their special features and where possible the evidence concerning their dating chapter 13 of himl various works on rasaśāstra and ratnaśāstra or various works on alchemy and gems gives brief details of a further 655 six hundred and fiftyfive treatises in some cases meulenbeld gives notes on the contents and authorship of these works in other cases references are made only to the unpublished manuscripts of these titles a great deal remains to be discovered about indian alchemical literature the content of the sanskrit alchemical corpus has not yet 2014 been adequately integrated into the wider general history of alchemy muslim world jabir ibn hayyan geber considered the father of chemistry introduced a scientific and experimental approach to alchemy after the fall of the roman empire the focus of alchemical development moved to the islamic world much more is known about islamic alchemy because it was better documented indeed most of the earlier writings that have come down through the years were preserved as arabic translations the word alchemy itself was derived from the arabic word alkīmiyā الكيمياء the early islamic world was a melting pot for alchemy platonic and aristotelian thought which had already been somewhat appropriated into hermetical science continued to be assimilated during the late 7th and early 8th centuries through syriac translations and scholarship in the late 8th century jābir ibn hayyān latinized as geber or geberus introduced a new approach to alchemy based on scientific methodology and controlled experimentation in the laboratory in contrast to the ancient greek and egyptian alchemists whose works were often allegorical and unintelligible with very little concern for laboratory work jabir is thus considered by many to be the father of chemistry albeit others reserve that title for robert boyle or antoine lavoisier the science historian paul kraus wrote jabir himself clearly recognized and proclaimed the importance of experimentation early islamic chemists such as jabir ibn hayyan alkindi alkindus and muhammad ibn zakarīya rāzi rasis or rhazes contributed a number of key chemical discoveries such as the muriatic hydrochloric acid sulfuric and nitric acids and more the discovery that aqua regia a mixture of nitric and hydrochloric acids could dissolve the noblest metal gold was to fuel the imagination of alchemists for the next millennium islamic philosophers also made great contributions to alchemical hermeticism the most influential author in this regard was arguably jabir jabirs ultimate goal was takwin the artificial creation of life in the alchemical laboratory up to and including human life he analyzed each aristotelian element in terms of four basic qualities of hotness coldness dryness and moistness according to jabir in each metal two of these qualities were interior and two were exterior for example lead was externally cold and dry while gold was hot and moist thus jabir theorized by rearranging the qualities of one metal a different metal would result by this reasoning the search for the philosophers stone was introduced to western alchemy jabir developed an elaborate numerology whereby the root letters of a substances name in arabic when treated with various transformations held correspondences to the elements physical properties the elemental system used in medieval alchemy also originated with jabir his original system consisted of seven elements which included the five classical elements aether air earth fire and water in addition to two chemical elements representing the metals sulphur the stone which burns which characterized the principle of combustibility and mercury which contained the idealized principle of metallic properties shortly thereafter this evolved into eight elements with the arabic concept of the three metallic principles sulphur giving flammability or combustion mercury giving volatility and stability and salt giving solidity the atomic theory of corpuscularianism where all physical bodies possess an inner and outer layer of minute particles or corpuscles also has its origins in the work of jabir from the 9th to 14th centuries alchemical theories faced criticism from a variety of practical muslim chemists including alkindus abū alrayhān albīrūnī avicenna and ibn khaldun in particular they wrote refutations against the idea of the transmutation of metals east asia taoist alchemists often use this alternate version of the taijitu whereas european alchemy eventually centered on the transmutation of base metals into noble metals chinese alchemy had a more obvious connection to medicine the philosophers stone of european alchemists can be compared to the grand elixir of immortality sought by chinese alchemists however in the hermetic view these two goals were not unconnected and the philosophers stone was often equated with the universal panacea therefore the two traditions may have had more in common than initially appears black powder may have been an important invention of chinese alchemists as previously stated above chinese alchemy was more related to medicine it is said that the chinese invented gunpowder while trying to find a potion for eternal life described in 9thcentury texts and used in fireworks in china by the 10th century it was used in cannons by 1290 from china the use of gunpowder spread to japan the mongols the muslim world and europe gunpowder was used by the mongols against the hungarians in 1241 and in europe by the 14th century chinese alchemy was closely connected to taoist forms of traditional chinese medicine such as acupuncture and moxibustion and to martial arts such as tai chi chuan and kung fu although some tai chi schools believe that their art derives from the philosophical or hygienic branches of taoism not alchemical in fact in the early song dynasty followers of this taoist idea chiefly the elite and upper class would ingest mercuric sulfide which though tolerable in low levels led many to suicide thinking that this consequential death would lead to freedom and access to the taoist heavens the ensuing deaths encouraged people to eschew this method of alchemy in favor of external sources the aforementioned tai chi chuan mastering of the qi etc medieval europe the alchemist in search of the philosophers stone by joseph wright 1771 an illuminated page from a book on alchemical processes and receipts ca 15th century the introduction of alchemy to latin europe may be dated to 11 february 1144 with the completion of robert of chesters translation of the arabic book of the composition of alchemy although european craftsmen and technicians preexisted robert notes in his preface that alchemy was unknown in latin europe at the time of his writing the translation of arabic texts concerning numerous disciplines including alchemy flourished in 12thcentury toledo spain through contributors like gerard of cremona and adelard of bath translations of the time included the turba philosophorum and the works of avicenna and alrazi these brought with them many new words to the european vocabulary for which there was no previous latin equivalent alcohol carboy elixir and athanor are examples meanwhile theologian contemporaries of the translators made strides towards the reconciliation of faith and experimental rationalism thereby priming europe for the influx of alchemical thought the 11thcentury st anselm put forth the opinion that faith and rationalism were compatible and encouraged rationalism in a christian context in the early 12th century peter abelard followed anselms work laying down the foundation for acceptance of aristotelian thought before the first works of aristotle had reached the west in the early 13th century robert grosseteste used abelards methods of analysis and added the use of observation experimentation and conclusions when conducting scientific investigations grosseteste also did much work to reconcile platonic and aristotelian thinking through much of the 12th and 13th centuries alchemical knowledge in europe remained centered on translations and new latin contributions were not made the efforts of the translators were succeeded by that of the encyclopaedists in the 13th century albertus magnus and roger bacon were the most notable of these their work summarizing and explaining the newly imported alchemical knowledge in aristotelian terms albertus magnus a dominican monk is known to have written works such as the book of minerals where he observed and commented on the operations and theories of alchemical authorities like hermes and democritus and unnamed alchemists of his time albertus critically compared these to the writings of aristotle and avicenna where they concerned the transmutation of metals from the time shortly after his death through to the 15th century more than 28 alchemical tracts were misattributed to him a common practice giving rise to his reputation as an accomplished alchemist likewise alchemical texts have been attributed to alberts student thomas aquinas roger bacon a franciscan monk who wrote on a wide variety of topics including optics comparative linguistics and medicine composed his great work for as part of a project towards rebuilding the medieval university curriculum to include the new learning of his time while alchemy was not more important to him than other sciences and he did not produce allegorical works on the topic he did consider it and astrology to be important parts of both natural philosophy and theology and his contributions advanced alchemys connections to soteriology and christian theology bacons writings integrated morality salvation alchemy and the prolongation of life his correspondence with clement highlighted this noting the importance of alchemy to the papacy like the greeks before him bacon acknowledged the division of alchemy into practical and theoretical spheres he noted that the theoretical lay outside the scope of aristotle the natural philosophers and all latin writers of his time the practical however confirmed the theoretical thought experiment and bacon advocated its uses in natural science and medicine in later european legend however bacon became an archmage in particular along with albertus magnus he was credited with the forging of a brazen head capable of answering its owners questions soon after bacon the influential work of pseudogeber sometimes identified as paul of taranto appeared his summa perfectionis remained a staple summary of alchemical practice and theory through the medieval and renaissance periods it was notable for its inclusion of practical chemical operations alongside sulphurmercury theory and the unusual clarity with which they were described by the end of the 13th century alchemy had developed into a fairly structured system of belief adepts believed in the macrocosmmicrocosm theories of hermes that is to say they believed that processes that affect minerals and other substances could have an effect on the human body for example if one could learn the secret of purifying gold one could use the technique to purify the human soul they believed in the four elements and the four qualities as described above and they had a strong tradition of cloaking their written ideas in a labyrinth of coded jargon set with traps to mislead the uninitiated finally the alchemists practiced their art they actively experimented with chemicals and made observations and theories about how the universe operated their entire philosophy revolved around their belief that mans soul was divided within himself after the fall of adam by purifying the two parts of mans soul man could be reunited with god in the 14th century alchemy became more accessible to europeans outside the confines of latin speaking churchmen and scholars alchemical discourse shifted from scholarly philosophical debate to an exposed social commentary on the alchemists themselves dante piers plowman and chaucer all painted unflattering pictures of alchemists as thieves and liars pope john xxiis 1317 edict spondent quas non exhibent forbade the false promises of transmutation made by pseudoalchemists in 1403 henry iv of england banned the practice of multiplying metals although it was possible to buy a licence to attempt to make gold alchemically and a number were granted by henry vi and edward iv these critiques and regulations centered more around pseudoalchemical charlatanism than the actual study of alchemy which continued with an increasingly christian tone the 14th century saw the christian imagery of death and resurrection employed in the alchemical texts of petrus bonus john of rupescissa and in works written in the name of raymond lull and arnold of villanova nicolas flamel is a wellknown alchemist but a good example of pseudepigraphy the practice of giving your works the name of someone else usually more famous though the historical flamel existed the writings and legends assigned to him only appeared in 1612 flamel was not a religious scholar as were many of his predecessors and his entire interest in the subject revolved around the pursuit of the philosophers stone his work spends a great deal of time describing the processes and reactions but never actually gives the formula for carrying out the transmutations most of his work was aimed at gathering alchemical knowledge that had existed before him especially as regarded the philosophers stone through the 14th and 15th centuries alchemists were much like flamel they concentrated on looking for the philosophers stone bernard trevisan and george ripley made similar contributions their cryptic allusions and symbolism led to wide variations in interpretation of the art renaissance and early modern europe page from alchemic treatise of ramon llull 16th century the red sun rising over the city the final illustration of 16th century alchemical text splendor solis the word rubedo meaning redness was adopted by alchemists and signalled alchemical success and the end of the great work during the renaissance hermetic and platonic foundations were restored to european alchemy the dawn of medical pharmaceutical occult and entrepreneurial branches of alchemy followed in the late 15th century marsilo ficino translated the corpus hermeticum and the works of plato into latin these were previously unavailable to europeans who for the first time had a full picture of the alchemical theory that bacon had declared absent renaissance humanism and renaissance neoplatonism guided alchemists away from physics to refocus on mankind as the alchemical vessel esoteric systems developed that blended alchemy into a broader occult hermeticism fusing it with magic astrology and christian cabala a key figure in this development was german heinrich cornelius agrippa 14861535 who received his hermetic education in italy in the schools of the humanists in his de occulta philosophia he attempted to merge kabbalah hermeticism and alchemy he was instrumental in spreading this new blend of hermeticism outside the borders of italy philippus aureolus paracelsus theophrastus bombastus von hohenheim 14931541 cast alchemy into a new form rejecting some of agrippas occultism and moving away from chrysopoeia paracelsus pioneered the use of chemicals and minerals in medicine and wrote many have said of alchemy that it is for the making of gold and silver for me such is not the aim but to consider only what virtue and power may lie in medicines his hermetical views were that sickness and health in the body relied on the harmony of man the microcosm and nature the macrocosm he took an approach different from those before him using this analogy not in the manner of soulpurification but in the manner that humans must have certain balances of minerals in their bodies and that certain illnesses of the body had chemical remedies that could cure them paracelsian practical alchemy especially herbal medicine and plant remedies has since been named spagyric a synonym for alchemy from the greek words meaning to separate and to join together based on the latin alchemic maxim solve et coagula iatrochemistry also refers to the pharmaceutical applications of alchemy championed by paracelsus john dee 13 july 1527 december 1608 followed agrippas occult tradition though better known for angel summoning divination and his role as astrologer cryptographer and consultant to queen elizabeth i dees alchemical monas hieroglyphica written in 1564 was his most popular and influential work his writing portrayed alchemy as a sort of terrestrial astronomy in line with the hermetic axiom as above so below during the 17th century a shortlived supernatural interpretation of alchemy became popular including support by fellows of the royal society robert boyle and elias ashmole proponents of the supernatural interpretation of alchemy believed that the philosophers stone might be used to summon and communicate with angels entrepreneurial opportunities were not uncommon for the alchemists of renaissance europe alchemists were contracted by the elite for practical purposes related to mining medical services and the production of chemicals medicines metals and gemstones rudolf ii holy roman emperor in the late 16th century famously received and sponsored various alchemists at his court in prague including dee and his associate edward kelley king james iv of scotland julius duke of brunswicklüneburg henry v duke of brunswicklüneburg augustus elector of saxony julius echter von mespelbrunn and maurice landgrave of hessekassel all contracted alchemists johns son arthur dee worked as a court physician to michael i of russia and charles i of england but also compiled the alchemical book fasciculus chemicus alchemist sendivogius 15661636 by jan matejko 1867 though most of these appointments were legitimate the trend of pseudoalchemical fraud continued through the renaissance betrüger would use sleight of hand or claims of secret knowledge to make money or secure patronage legitimate mystical and medical alchemists such as michael maier and heinrich khunrath wrote about fraudulent transmutations distinguishing themselves from the con artists false alchemists were sometimes prosecuted for fraud the terms chemia and alchemia were used as synonyms in the early modern period and the differences between alchemy chemistry and smallscale assaying and metallurgy were not as neat as in the present day there were important overlaps between practitioners and trying to classify them into alchemists chemists and craftsmen is anachronistic for example tycho brahe 15461601 an alchemist better known for his astronomical and astrological investigations had a laboratory built at his uraniborg observatoryresearch institute michael sendivogius michał sędziwój 15661636 a polish alchemist philosopher medical doctor and pioneer of chemistry wrote mystical works but is also credited with distilling oxygen in a lab sometime around 1600 sendivogious taught his technique to cornelius drebbel who in 1621 applied this in a submarine isaac newton devoted considerably more of his writing to the study of alchemy see isaac newtons occult studies than he did to either optics or physics other early modern alchemists who were eminent in their other studies include robert boyle and jan baptist van helmont their hermeticism complemented rather than precluded their practical achievements in medicine and science late modern period robert boyle the decline of european alchemy was brought about by the rise of modern science with its emphasis on rigorous quantitative experimentation and its disdain for ancient wisdom although the seeds of these events were planted as early as the 17th century alchemy still flourished for some two hundred years and in fact may have reached its apogee in the 18th century as late as 1781 james price claimed to have produced a powder that could transmute mercury into silver or gold early modern european alchemy continued to exhibit a diversity of theories practices and purposes scholastic and antiaristotelian paracelsian and antiparacelsian hermetic neoplatonic mechanistic vitalistic and moreplus virtually every combination and compromise thereof robert boyle 16271691 pioneered the scientific method in chemical investigations he assumed nothing in his experiments and compiled every piece of relevant data boyle would note the place in which the experiment was carried out the wind characteristics the position of the sun and moon and the barometer reading all just in case they proved to be relevant this approach eventually led to the founding of modern chemistry in the 18th and 19th centuries based on revolutionary discoveries of lavoisier and john dalton beginning around 1720 a rigid distinction was drawn between alchemy and chemistry for the first time by the 1740s alchemy was now restricted to the realm of gold making leading to the popular belief that alchemists were charlatans and the tradition itself nothing more than a fraud in order to protect the developing science of modern chemistry from the negative censure of which alchemy was being subjected academic writers during the scientific enlightenment attempted for the sake of survival to separate and divorce the new chemistry from the old practices of alchemy this move was mostly successful and the consequences of this continued into the 19th and 20th centuries and even to the present day during the occult revival of the early 19th century alchemy received new attention as an occult science the esoteric or occultist school which arose during the 19th century held and continues to hold the view that the substances and operations mentioned in alchemical literature are to be interpreted in a spiritual sense and it downplays the role of the alchemy as a practical tradition or protoscience this interpretation further forwarded the view that alchemy is an art primarily concerned with spiritual enlightenment or illumination as opposed to the physical manipulation of apparatus and chemicals and claims that the obscure language of the alchemical texts were an allegorical guise for spiritual moral or mystical processes in the 19thcentury revival of alchemy the two most seminal figures were mary anne atwood and ethan allen hitchcock who independently published similar works regarding spiritual alchemy both forwarded a completely esoteric view of alchemy as atwood claimed no modern art or chemistry notwithstanding all its surreptitious claims has any thing in common with alchemy atwoods work influenced subsequent authors of the occult revival including eliphas levi arthur edward waite and rudolf steiner hitchcock in his remarks upon alchymists 1855 attempted to make a case for his spiritual interpretation with his claim that the alchemists wrote about a spiritual discipline under a materialistic guise in order to avoid accusations of blasphemy from the church and state in 1845 baron carl reichenbach published his studies on odic force a concept with some similarities to alchemy but his research did not enter the mainstream of scientific discussion women in alchemy several women figure in the earliest history of alchemy michael maier names mary the jewess cleopatra the alchemist medera and taphnutia as the four women who knew how to make the philosophers stone zosimos sister theosebia later known as euthica the arab and isis the prophetess also play a role in the early alchemical texts the first alchemist is recognized as being mary the jewess c 200 ad mary is known for a number of improvements on alchemy equipment and tools as well as novel techniques in chemistry her most wellknown advancements are heating and distillation processes the waterbath also known as bainmarie is said to have been invented by or at least improved by her this doubleboiler was often used in chemistry for processes that might require gentle heating the tribikos a basic still and the kerotakis a more intricate distilling apparatus are two other advancements in the process of distillation that are credited to her while these were great achievements mary the jewess most critical contribution is considered to be the identification of hydrochloric acid a frequently used chemical today though we have no writing from maria herself she is known from the fourth century writings of zosimos of panopolis due to the proliferation of pseudepigrapha and anonymous works it is difficult to know which of the alchemists were actually women after the grecoroman period womens names appear less frequently the alchemical literature women vacate the history of alchemy during the medieval and renaissance periods aside from the fictitious account of perenelle flamel mary anne atwoods a suggestive inquiry into the hermetic mystery 1850 marks their return during the nineteenth century occult revival modern historical research the history of alchemy has become a significant and recognized subject of academic study as the language of the alchemists is analyzed historians are becoming more aware of the intellectual connections between that discipline and other facets of western cultural history such as the evolution of science and philosophy the sociology and psychology of the intellectual communities kabbalism spiritualism rosicrucianism and other mystic movements institutions involved in this research include the chymistry of isaac newton project at indiana university

22,kimiyayi saādat the alchemy of happiness a text on islamic philosophy and spiritual alchemy by alghazālī 10581111 alchemy is a philosophical and protoscientific tradition practiced throughout europe africa and asia it aimed to purify mature and perfect certain objects common aims were chrysopoeia the transmutation of base metals eg lead into noble metals particularly gold the creation of an elixir of immortality the creation of panaceas able to cure any disease and the development of an alkahest a universal solvent the perfection of the human body and soul was thought to permit or result from the alchemical magnum opus and in the hellenistic and western tradition the achievement of gnosis in europe the creation of a philosophers stone was variously connected with all of these projects in english the term is often limited to descriptions of european alchemy but similar practices existed in the far east the indian subcontinent and the muslim world in europe following the 12thcentury renaissance produced by the translation of islamic works on science and the recovery of aristotle alchemists played a significant role in early modern science particularly chemistry and medicine islamic and european alchemists developed a structure of basic laboratory techniques theory terminology and experimental method some of which are still in use today however they continued antiquitys belief in four elements and guarded their work in secrecy including cyphers and cryptic symbolism their work was guided by hermetic principles related to magic mythology and religion modern discussions of alchemy are generally split into an examination of its exoteric practical applications and its esoteric spiritual aspects despite the arguments of scholars like holmyard and von franz that they should be understood as complementary the former is pursued by historians of the physical sciences who examine the subject in terms of early chemistry medicine and charlatanism and the philosophical and religious contexts in which these events occurred the latter interests historians of esotericism psychologists and some philosophers and spiritualists the subject has also made an ongoing impact on literature and the arts despite this split which von franz believes has existed since the western traditions origin in a mix of greek philosophy that was mixed with egyptian and mesopotamian technology numerous sources have stressed an integration of esoteric and exoteric approaches to alchemy as far back as pseudodemocrituss firstcentury on physical and mystical matters
22,due to the complexity and obscurity of alchemical literature and the 18thcentury disappearance of remaining alchemical practitioners into the area of chemistry the general understanding of alchemy has been strongly influenced by several distinct and radically different interpretations those focusing on the exoteric such as historians of science lawrence m principe and william r newman have interpreted the decknamen or code words of alchemy as physical substances these scholars have reconstructed physicochemical experiments that they say are described in medieval and early modern texts at the opposite end of the spectrum focusing on the esoteric scholars such as george calian and anna marie roos who question the reading of principe and newman interpret these same decknamen as spiritual religious or psychological concepts today new interpretations of alchemy are still perpetuated sometimes merging in concepts from new age or radical environmentalism movements groups like the rosicrucians and freemasons have a continued interest in alchemy and its symbolism since the victorian revival of alchemy occultists reinterpreted alchemy as a spiritual practice involving the selftransformation of the practitioner and only incidentally or not at all the transformation of laboratory substances which has contributed to a merger of magic and alchemy in popular thought traditional medicine traditional medicine can use the concept of the transmutation of natural substances using pharmacological or a combination of pharmacological and spiritual techniques in ayurveda the samskaras are claimed to transform heavy metals and toxic herbs in a way that removes their toxicity these processes are actively used to the present day spagyrists of the 20th century albert richard riedel and jean dubuis merged paracelsian alchemy with occultism teaching laboratory pharmaceutical methods the schools they founded les philosophes de la nature and the paracelsus research society popularized modern spagyrics including the manufacture of herbal tinctures and products the courses books organizations and conferences generated by their students continue to influence popular applications of alchemy as a new age medicinal practice psychology alchemical symbolism has been important in depth and analytical psychology and was revived and popularized from near extinction by the swiss psychologist carl gustav jung initially confounded and at odds with alchemy and its images after being given a copy of the translation of the secret of the golden flower a chinese alchemical text by his friend richard wilhelm jung discovered a direct correlation or parallels between the symbolic images in the alchemical drawings and the inner symbolic images coming up in dreams visions or imaginations during the psychic processes of transformation occurring in his patients a process which he called process of individuation he regarded the alchemical images as symbols expressing aspects of this process of individuation of which the creation of the gold or lapis within were symbols for its origin and goal together with his alchemical mystica soror jungian swiss analyst marielouise von franz jung began collecting all the old alchemical texts available compiled a lexicon of key phrases with crossreferences and pored over them the volumes of work he wrote brought new light into understanding the art of transubstantiation and renewed alchemys popularity as a symbolic process of coming into wholeness as a human being where opposites brought into contact and inner and outer spirit and matter are reunited in the hieros gamos or divine marriage his writings are influential in psychology and for persons who have an interest in understanding of the importance of dreams symbols and the unconscious archetypal forces archetypes that influence all of life both von franz and jung have contributed greatly to the subject and work of alchemy and its continued presence in psychology as well as contemporary culture jung wrote volumes on alchemy and his magnum opus is volume 14 of his collected works mysterium conuinctionis literature alchemy has had a longstanding relationship with art seen both in alchemical texts and in mainstream entertainment literary alchemy appears throughout the history of english literature from shakespeare to j k rowling here characters or plot structure follow an alchemical magnum opus in the 14th century chaucer began a trend of alchemical satire that can still be seen in recent fantasy works like those of terry pratchett visual artists had a similar relationship with alchemy while some of them used alchemy as a source of satire others worked with the alchemists themselves or integrated alchemical thought or symbols in their work music was also present in the works of alchemists and continues to influence popular performers in the last hundred years alchemists have been portrayed in a magical and spagyric role in fantasy fiction film television novels comics and video games

24,the astronomer by johannes vermeer an astronomer is a scientist in the field of astronomy who concentrates their studies on a specific question or field outside the scope of earth they look at stars planets moons comets and galaxies as well as many other celestial objects either in observational astronomy in analyzing the data or in theoretical astronomy examples of topics or fields astronomers work on include planetary science solar astronomy the origin or evolution of stars or the formation of galaxies there are also related but distinct subjects like physical cosmology which studies the universe as a whole astronomers usually fit into two types observational and theoretical observational astronomers make direct observations of planets stars and galaxies and analyze the data in contrast theoretical astronomers create and investigate models of things that cannot be observed because it takes millions to billions of years for a system of stars or a galaxy to complete a life cycle astronomers have to observe snapshots of different systems at unique points in their evolution to determine how they form evolve and die they use this data to create models or simulations to theorize how different celestial bodies work there are further subcategories inside these two main branches of astronomy such as planetary astronomy galactic astronomy or physical cosmology

24,galileo is often referred to as the father of modern astronomy historically astronomy was more concerned with the classification and description of phenomena in the sky while astrophysics attempted to explain these phenomena and the differences between them using physical laws today that distinction has mostly disappeared and the terms astronomer and astrophysicist are interchangeable professional astronomers are highly educated individuals who typically have a phd in physics or astronomy and are employed by research institutions or universities they spend the majority of their time working on research although they quite often have other duties such as teaching building instruments or aiding in the operation of an observatory the number of professional astronomers in the united states is actually quite small the american astronomical society which is the major organization of professional astronomers in north america has approximately 7000 members this number includes scientists from other fields such as physics geology and engineering whose research interests are closely related to astronomy the international astronomical union comprises almost 10145 members from 70 different countries who are involved in astronomical research at the phd level and beyond guy consolmagno vatican observatory analyzing a meteorite 2014 contrary to the classical image of an old astronomer peering through a telescope through the dark hours of the night it is far more common to use a chargecoupled device ccd camera to record a long deep exposure allowing a more sensitive image to be created because the light is added over time before ccds photographic plates were a common method of observation modern astronomers spend relatively little time at telescopes usually just a few weeks per year analysis of observed phenomena along with making predictions as to the causes of what they observe takes the majority of observational astronomers time astronomers who serve as faculty spend much of their time teaching undergraduate and graduate classes most universities also have outreach programs including public telescope time and sometimes planetariums as a public service to encourage interest in the field those who become astronomers usually have a broad background in maths sciences and computing in high school taking courses that teach how to research write and present papers are also invaluable in collegeuniversity most astronomers get a phd in astronomy or physics keeping in mind how few astronomers there are it is understood that graduate schools in this field are very competitive so grades are very important students must take a graduate record exam in the united states if they wish to be accepted into a us graduate school
24,emily lakdawalla at the planetary conference 2013 while there is a relatively low number of professional astronomers the field is popular among amateurs most cities have amateur astronomy clubs that meet on a regular basis and often host star parties the astronomical society of the pacific is the largest general astronomical society in the world comprising both professional and amateur astronomers as well as educators from 70 different nations like any hobby most people who think of themselves as amateur astronomers may devote a few hours a month to stargazing and reading the latest developments in research however amateurs span the range from socalled armchair astronomers to the very ambitious who own sciencegrade telescopes and instruments with which they are able to make their own discoveries and assist professional astronomers in research

25,ascii was developed from telegraph code its first commercial use was as a sevenbit teleprinter code promoted by bell data services work on the ascii standard began on october 6 1960 with the first meeting of the american standards associations asa now the american national standards institute or ansi x32 subcommittee the first edition of the standard was published in 1963 underwent a major revision during 1967 and experienced its most recent update during 1986 compared to earlier telegraph codes the proposed bell code and ascii were both ordered for more convenient sorting ie alphabetization of lists and added features for devices other than teleprinters originally based on the english alphabet ascii encodes 128 specified characters into sevenbit integers as shown by the ascii chart above ninetyfive of the encoded characters are printable these include the digits 0 to 9 lowercase letters a to z uppercase letters a to z and punctuation symbols in addition the original ascii specification included 33 nonprinting control codes which originated with teletype machines most of these are now obsolete for example lowercase i would be represented in the ascii encoding by binary 1101001 hexadecimal 69 i is the ninth letter decimal 105

25,ascii was first used commercially during 1963 as a sevenbit teleprinter code for american telephone telegraphs twx teletypewriter exchange network twx originally used the earlier fivebit ita2 which was also used by the competing telex teleprinter system bob bemer introduced features such as the escape sequence his british colleague hugh mcgregor ross helped to popularize this work according to bemer so much so that the code that was to become ascii was first called the bemerross code in europe because of his extensive work on ascii bemer has been called the father of ascii on march 11 1968 us president lyndon b johnson mandated that all computers purchased by the united states federal government support ascii stating i have also approved recommendations of the secretary of commerce regarding standards for recording the standard code for information interchange on magnetic tapes and paper tapes when they are used in computer operations all computers and related equipment configurations brought into the federal government inventory on and after july 1 1969 must have the capability to use the standard code for information interchange and the formats prescribed by the magnetic tape and paper tape standards when these media are used ascii was the most common character encoding on the world wide web until december 2007 when utf8 encoding surpassed it utf8 is backward compatible with ascii
25,as computer technology spread throughout the world different standards bodies and corporations developed many variations of ascii to facilitate the expression of nonenglish languages that used romanbased alphabets one could class some of these variations as ascii extensions although some misuse that term to represent all variants including those that do not preserve asciis charactermap in the 7bit range furthermore the ascii extensions have also been mislabelled as ascii 7bit codes from early in its development ascii was intended to be just one of several national variants of an international character code standard other international standards bodies have ratified character encodings such as iso 646 1967 that are identical or nearly identical to ascii with extensions for characters outside the english alphabet and symbols used outside the united states such as the symbol for the united kingdoms pound sterling almost every country needed an adapted version of ascii since ascii suited the needs of only the us and a few other countries for example canada had its own version that supported french characters many other countries developed variants of ascii to include nonenglish letters eg é ñ ß ł currency symbols eg etc see also yuscii yugoslavia it would share most characters in common but assign other locally useful characters to several code points reserved for national use however the four years that elapsed between the publication of ascii1963 and isos first acceptance of an international recommendation during 1967 caused asciis choices for the national use characters to seem to be de facto standards for the world causing confusion and incompatibility once other countries did begin to make their own assignments to these code points isoiec 646 like ascii is a 7bit character set it does not make any additional codes available so the same code points encoded different characters in different countries escape codes were defined to indicate which national variant applied to a piece of text but they were rarely used so it was often impossible to know what variant to work with and therefore which character a code represented and in general textprocessing systems could cope with only one variant anyway because the bracket and brace characters of ascii were assigned to national use code points that were used for accented letters in other national variants of isoiec 646 a german french or swedish etc programmer using their national variant of isoiec 646 rather than ascii had to write and thus read something such as ä aäiü ön ü instead of ai n c trigraphs were created to solve this problem for ansi c although their late introduction and inconsistent implementation in compilers limited their use many programmers kept their computers on usascii so plaintext in swedish german etc for example in email or usenet contained and similar variants in the middle of words something those programmers got used to for example a swedish programmer mailing another programmer asking if they should go for lunch could get n jag har smrgsar as the answer which should be nä jag har smörgåsar meaning no ive got sandwiches 8bit codes eventually as 8 16 and 32bit and later 64bit computers began to replace 18 and 36bit computers as the norm it became common to use an 8bit byte to store each character in memory providing an opportunity for extended 8bit relatives of ascii in most cases these developed as true extensions of ascii leaving the original charactermapping intact but adding additional character definitions after the first 128 ie 7bit characters encodings include iscii india viscii vietnam although these encodings are sometimes referred to as ascii true ascii is defined strictly only by the ansi standard most early home computer systems developed their own 8bit character sets containing linedrawing and game glyphs and often filled in some or all of the control characters from 0 to 31 with more graphics kaypro cpm computers used the upper 128 characters for the greek alphabet the petscii code commodore international used for their 8bit systems is probably unique among post1970 codes in being based on ascii1963 instead of the more common ascii1967 such as found on the zx spectrum computer atari 8bit computers and galaksija computers also used ascii variants the ibm pc defined code page 437 which replaced the control characters with graphic symbols such as smiley faces and mapped additional graphic characters to the upper 128 positions operating systems such as dos supported these code pages and manufacturers of ibm pcs supported them in hardware digital equipment corporation developed the multinational character set decmcs for use in the popular vt220 terminal as one of the first extensions designed more for international languages than for block graphics the macintosh defined mac os roman and postscript also defined a set both of these contained both international letters and typographic punctuation marks instead of graphics more like modern character sets the isoiec 8859 standard derived from the decmcs finally provided a standard that most systems copied at least as accurately as they copied ascii but with many substitutions a popular further extension designed by microsoft windows1252 often mislabeled as iso88591 added the typographic punctuation marks needed for traditional text printing iso88591 windows1252 and the original 7bit ascii were the most common character encodings until 2008 when utf8 became more common isoiec 4873 introduced 32 additional control codes defined in the 809f hexadecimal range as part of extending the 7bit ascii encoding to become an 8bit system unicode unicode and the isoiec 10646 universal character set ucs have a much wider array of characters and their various encoding forms have begun to supplant isoiec 8859 and ascii rapidly in many environments while ascii is limited to 128 characters unicode and the ucs support more characters by separating the concepts of unique identification using natural numbers called code points and encoding to 8 16 or 32bit binary formats called utf8 utf16 and utf32 ascii was incorporated into the unicode 1991 character set as the first 128 symbols so the 7bit ascii characters have the same numeric codes in both sets this allows utf8 to be backward compatible with 7bit ascii as a utf8 file containing only ascii characters is identical to an ascii file containing the same sequence of characters even more importantly forward compatibility is ensured as software that recognizes only 7bit ascii characters as special and does not alter bytes with the highest bit set as is often done to support 8bit ascii extensions such as iso88591 will preserve utf8 data unchanged to allow backward compatibility the 128 ascii and 256 iso88591 latin 1 characters are assigned unicodeucs code points that are the same as their codes in the earlier standards therefore ascii can be considered a 7bit encoding scheme for a very small subset of unicodeucs and ascii when prefixed with 0 as the eighth bit is valid utf8
25,ascii abbreviated from american standard code for information interchange is a character encoding standard for electronic communication ascii codes represent text in computers telecommunications equipment and other devices most modern characterencoding schemes are based on ascii although they support many additional characters ascii is the traditional name for the encoding system the internet assigned numbers authority iana prefers the updated name usascii which clarifies that this system was developed in the us and based on the typographical symbols predominantly in use there ascii chart from a 1972 printer manual b1 is the least significant bit

25,bit width the x32 subcommittee designed ascii based on the earlier teleprinter encoding systems like other character encodings ascii specifies a correspondence between digital bit patterns and character symbols ie graphemes and control characters this allows digital devices to communicate with each other and to process store and communicate characteroriented information such as written language before ascii was developed the encodings in use included 26 alphabetic characters 10 numerical digits and from 11 to 25 special graphic symbols to include all these and control characters compatible with the comité consultatif international téléphonique et télégraphique ccitt international telegraph alphabet no 2 ita2 standard of 1924 fieldata 1956 and early ebcdic 1963 more than 64 codes were required for ascii ita2 were in turn based on the 5bit telegraph code émile baudot invented in 1870 and patented in 1874 the committee debated the possibility of a shift function like in ita2 which would allow more than 64 codes to be represented by a sixbit code in a shifted code some character codes determine choices between options for the following character codes it allows compact encoding but is less reliable for data transmission as an error in transmitting the shift code typically makes a long part of the transmission unreadable the standards committee decided against shifting and so ascii required at least a sevenbit code the committee considered an eightbit code since eight bits octets would allow two fourbit patterns to efficiently encode two digits with binarycoded decimal however it would require all data transmission to send eight bits when seven could suffice the committee voted to use a sevenbit code to minimize costs associated with data transmission since perforated tape at the time could record eight bits in one position it also allowed for a parity bit for error checking if desired eightbit machines with octets as the native data type that did not use parity checking typically set the eighth bit to 0 in some printers the high bit was used to enable italics printing internal organization the code itself was patterned so that most control codes were together and all graphic codes were together for ease of identification the first two so called ascii sticks 32 positions were reserved for control characters the space character had to come before graphics to make sorting easier so it became position 20hex for the same reason many special signs commonly used as separators were placed before digits the committee decided it was important to support uppercase 64character alphabets and chose to pattern ascii so it could be reduced easily to a usable 64character set of graphic codes as was done in the dec sixbit code 1963 lowercase letters were therefore not interleaved with uppercase to keep options available for lowercase letters and other graphics the special and numeric codes were arranged before the letters and the letter a was placed in position 41hex to match the draft of the corresponding british standard the digits 09 are prefixed with 011 but the remaining 4 bits correspond to their respective values in binary making conversion with binarycoded decimal straightforward many of the nonalphanumeric characters were positioned to correspond to their shifted position on typewriters an important subtlety is that these were based on mechanical typewriters not electric typewriters mechanical typewriters followed the standard set by the remington no 2 1878 the first typewriter with a shift key and the shifted values of 23456789 were _ early typewriters omitted 0 and 1 using o capital letter o and l lowercase letter l instead but 1 and 0 pairs became standard once 0 and 1 became common thus in ascii were placed in the second stick positions 15 corresponding to the digits 15 in the adjacent stick the parentheses could not correspond to 9 and 0 however because the place corresponding to 0 was taken by the space character this was accommodated by removing _ underscore from 6 and shifting the remaining characters which corresponded to many european typewriters that placed the parentheses with 8 and 9 this discrepancy from typewriters led to bitpaired keyboards notably the teletype model 33 which used the leftshifted layout corresponding to ascii not to traditional mechanical typewriters electric typewriters notably the ibm selectric 1961 used a somewhat different layout that has become standard on computers following the ibm pc 1981 especially model m 1984 and thus shift values for symbols on modern keyboards do not correspond as closely to the ascii table as earlier keyboards did the pair also dates to the no 2 and the pairs were used on some keyboards others including the no 2 did not shift comma or full stop so they could be used in uppercase without unshifting however ascii split the pair dating to no 2 and rearranged mathematical symbols varied conventions commonly to some common characters were not included notably ½¼ while were included as diacritics for international use and for mathematical use together with the simple line characters in addition to common the symbol was not used in continental europe and the committee expected it would be replaced by an accented à in the french variation so the was placed in position 40hex right before the letter a the control codes felt essential for data transmission were the start of message som end of address eoa end of message eom end of transmission eot who are you wru are you ru a reserved device control dc0 synchronous idle sync and acknowledge ack these were positioned to maximize the hamming distance between their bit patterns character order asciicode order is also called asciibetical order collation of data is sometimes done in this order rather than standard alphabetical order collating sequence the main deviations in ascii order are all uppercase come before lowercase letters for example z precedes a digits and many punctuation marks come before letters numbers are sorted naïvely as strings for example 10 precedes 2 an intermediate order readily implemented converts uppercase letters to lowercase before comparing ascii values naïve number sorting can be averted by zerofilling all numbers eg 02 will sort before 10 as expected although this is an external fix and has nothing to do with the ordering itself

25,the american standard code for information interchange ascii was developed under the auspices of a committee of the american standards association asa called the x3 committee by its x32 later x3l2 subcommittee and later by that subcommittees x324 working group now incits the asa became the united states of america standards institute usasi and ultimately the american national standards institute ansi with the other special characters and control codes filled in ascii was published as asa x341963 leaving 28 code positions without any assigned meaning reserved for future standardization and one unassigned control code there was some debate at the time whether there should be more control characters rather than the lowercase alphabet the indecision did not last long during may 1963 the ccitt working party on the new telegraph alphabet proposed to assign lowercase characters to sticks 6 and 7 and international organization for standardization tc 97 sc 2 voted during october to incorporate the change into its draft standard the x324 task group voted its approval for the change to ascii at its may 1963 meeting locating the lowercase letters in sticks 6 and 7 caused the characters to differ in bit pattern from the upper case by a single bit which simplified caseinsensitive character matching and the construction of keyboards and printers the x3 committee made other changes including other new characters the brace and vertical bar characters renaming some control characters som became start of header soh and moving or removing others ru was removed ascii was subsequently updated as usas x341967 then usas x341968 ansi x341977 and finally ansi x341986 revisions of the ascii standard asa x341963 asa x341965 approved but not published nevertheless used by ibm 2260 2265 display stations and ibm 2848 display control usas x341967 usas x341968 ansi x341977 ansi x341986 ansi x341986 r1992 ansi x341986 r1997 ansi incits 41986 r2002 ansi incits 41986 r2007 ansi incits 41986 r2012 in the x315 standard the x3 committee also addressed how ascii should be transmitted least significant bit first and how it should be recorded on perforated tape they proposed a 9track standard for magnetic tape and attempted to deal with some punched card formats
25,control characters ascii reserves the first 32 codes numbers 031 decimal for control characters codes originally intended not to represent printable information but rather to control devices such as printers that make use of ascii or to provide metainformation about data streams such as those stored on magnetic tape for example character 10 represents the line feed function which causes a printer to advance its paper and character 8 represents backspace rfc 2822 refers to control characters that do not include carriage return line feed or white space as nonwhitespace control characters except for the control characters that prescribe elementary lineoriented formatting ascii does not define any mechanism for describing the structure or appearance of text within a document other schemes such as markup languages address page and document layout and formatting the original ascii standard used only short descriptive phrases for each control character the ambiguity this caused was sometimes intentional for example where a character would be used slightly differently on a terminal link than on a data stream and sometimes accidental for example with the meaning of delete probably the most influential single device on the interpretation of these characters was the teletype model 33 asr which was a printing terminal with an available paper tape readerpunch option paper tape was a very popular medium for longterm program storage until the 1980s less costly and in some ways less fragile than magnetic tape in particular the teletype model 33 machine assignments for codes 17 controlq dc1 also known as xon 19 controls dc3 also known as xoff and 127 delete became de facto standards the model 33 was also notable for taking the description of controlg code 7 bel meaning audibly alert the operator literally as the unit contained an actual bell which it rang when it received a bel character because the keytop for the o key also showed a leftarrow symbol from ascii1963 which had this character instead of underscore a noncompliant use of code 15 controlo shift in interpreted as delete previous character was also adopted by many early timesharing systems but eventually became neglected when a teletype 33 asr equipped with the automatic paper tape reader received a controls xoff an abbreviation for transmit off it caused the tape reader to stop receiving controlq xon transmit on caused the tape reader to resume this technique became adopted by several early computer operating systems as a handshaking signal warning a sender to stop transmission because of impending overflow it persists to this day in many systems as a manual output control technique on some systems controls retains its meaning but controlq is replaced by a second controls to resume output the 33 asr also could be configured to employ controlr dc2 and controlt dc4 to start and stop the tape punch on some units equipped with this function the corresponding control character lettering on the keycap above the letter was tape and tape respectively code 127 is officially named delete but the teletype label was rubout since the original standard did not give detailed interpretation for most control codes interpretations of this code varied the original teletype meaning and the intent of the standard was to make it an ignored character the same as nul all zeroes this was useful specifically for paper tape because punching the allones bit pattern on top of an existing mark would obliterate it tapes designed to be hand edited could even be produced with spaces of extra nuls blank tape so that a block of characters could be rubbed out and then replacements put into the empty space some software assigned special meanings to ascii characters sent to the software from the terminal operating systems from digital equipment corporation for example interpreted del as an input character as meaning remove previouslytyped input character and this interpretation also became common in unix systems most other systems used bs for that meaning and used del to mean remove the character at the cursor that latter interpretation is the most common now many more of the control codes have been given meanings quite different from their original ones the escape character esc code 27 for example was intended originally to allow sending other control characters as literals instead of invoking their meaning this is the same meaning of escape encountered in url encodings c language strings and other systems where certain characters have a reserved meaning over time this meaning has been coopted and has eventually been changed in modern use an esc sent to the terminal usually indicates the start of a command sequence usually in the form of a socalled ansi escape code or more properly a control sequence introducer from ecma48 1972 and its successors beginning with esc followed by a leftbracket character an esc sent from the terminal is most often used as an outofband character used to terminate an operation as in the teco and vi text editors in graphical user interface gui and windowing systems esc generally causes an application to abort its current operation or to exit terminate altogether the inherent ambiguity of many control characters combined with their historical usage created problems when transferring plain text files between systems the best example of this is the newline problem on various operating systems teletype machines required that a line of text be terminated with both carriage return which moves the printhead to the beginning of the line and line feed which advances the paper one line without moving the printhead the name carriage return comes from the fact that on a manual typewriter the carriage holding the paper moved while the position where the typebars struck the ribbon remained stationary the entire carriage had to be pushed returned to the right in order to position the left margin of the paper for the next line dec operating systems os8 rt11 rsx11 rsts tops10 etc used both characters to mark the end of a line so that the console device originally teletype machines would work by the time socalled glass ttys later called crts or terminals came along the convention was so well established that backward compatibility necessitated continuing the convention when gary kildall created cpm he was inspired by some command line interface conventions used in decs rt11 until the introduction of pc dos in 1981 ibm had no hand in this because their 1970s operating systems used ebcdic instead of ascii and they were oriented toward punchcard input and line printer output on which the concept of carriage return was meaningless ibms pc dos also marketed as msdos by microsoft inherited the convention by virtue of being a clone of cpm and windows inherited it from msdos unfortunately requiring two characters to mark the end of a line introduces unnecessary complexity and questions as to how to interpret each character when encountered alone to simplify matters plain text data streams including files on multics used line feed lf alone as a line terminator unix and unixlike systems and amiga systems adopted this convention from multics the original macintosh os apple dos and prodos on the other hand used carriage return cr alone as a line terminator however since apple replaced these operating systems with the unixbased macos operating system they now use line feed lf as well the radio shack trs80 also used a lone cr to terminate lines computers attached to the arpanet included machines running operating systems such as tops10 and tenex using crlf line endings machines running operating systems such as multics using lf line endings and machines running operating systems such as os360 that represented lines as a character count followed by the characters of the line and that used ebcdic rather than ascii the telnet protocol defined an ascii network virtual terminal nvt so that connections between hosts with different lineending conventions and character sets could be supported by transmitting a standard text format over the network telnet used ascii along with crlf line endings and software using other conventions would translate between the local conventions and the nvt the file transfer protocol adopted the telnet protocol including use of the network virtual terminal for use when transmitting commands and transferring data in the default ascii mode this adds complexity to implementations of those protocols and to other network protocols such as those used for email and the world wide web on systems not using the nvts crlf lineending convention older operating systems such as tops10 along with cpm tracked file length only in units of disk blocks and used controlz sub to mark the end of the actual text in the file for this reason eof or endoffile was used colloquially and conventionally as a threeletter acronym for controlz instead of substitute the endoftext code etx also known as controlc was inappropriate for a variety of reasons while using z as the control code to end a file is analogous to it ending the alphabet and serves as a very convenient mnemonic aid a historically common and still prevalent convention uses the etx code convention to interrupt and halt a program via an input data stream usually from a keyboard in c library and unix conventions the null character is used to terminate text strings such nullterminated strings can be known in abbreviation as asciz or asciiz where

27,the creation of nontrivial animation works ie longer than a few seconds has developed as a form of filmmaking with certain unique aspects one thing liveaction and animated featurelength films do have in common is that they are both extremely laborintensive and have high production costs the most important difference is that once a film is in the production phase the marginal cost of one more shot is higher for animated films than liveaction films it is relatively easy for a director to ask for one more take during principal photography of a liveaction film but every take on an animated film must be manually rendered by animators although the task of rendering slightly different takes has been made less tedious by modern computer animation it is pointless for a studio to pay the salaries of dozens of animators to spend weeks creating a visually dazzling fiveminute scene if that scene fails to effectively advance the plot of the film thus animation studios starting with disney began the practice in the 1930s of maintaining story departments where storyboard artists develop every single scene through storyboards then handing the film over to the animators only after the production team is satisfied that all the scenes will make sense as a whole while liveaction films are now also storyboarded they enjoy more latitude to depart from storyboards ie realtime improvisation another problem unique to animation is the necessity of ensuring that the style of an animated film is consistent from start to finish even as films have grown longer and teams have grown larger animators like all artists necessarily have their own individual styles but must subordinate their individuality in a consistent way to whatever style was selected for a particular film since the early 1980s featurelength animated films have been created by teams of about 500 to 600 people of whom 50 to 70 are animators it is relatively easy for two or three artists to match each others styles it is harder to keep dozens of artists synchronized with one another this problem is usually solved by having a separate group of visual development artists develop an overall look and palette for each film before animation begins character designers on the visual development team draw model sheets to show how each character should look like with different facial expressions posed in different positions and viewed from different angles on traditionally animated projects maquettes were often sculpted to further help the animators see how characters would look from different angles unlike liveaction films animated films were traditionally developed beyond the synopsis stage through the storyboard format the storyboard artists would then receive credit for writing the film in the early 1960s animation studios began hiring professional screenwriters to write screenplays while also continuing to use story departments and screenplays had become commonplace for animated films by the late 1980s
27,as with any other form of media animation too has instituted awards for excellence in the field the original awards for animation were presented by the academy of motion picture arts and sciences for animated shorts from the year 1932 during the 5th academy awards function the first winner of the academy award was the short flowers and trees a production by walt disney productions the academy award for a featurelength animated motion picture was only instituted for the year 2001 and awarded during the 74th academy awards in 2002 it was won by the film shrek produced by dreamworks and pacific data images disneypixar have produced the most films either to win or be nominated for the award the list of both awards can be obtained here academy award for best animated feature academy award for best animated short film several other countries have instituted an award for best animated feature film as part of their national film awards africa movie academy award for best animation since 2008 bafta award for best animated film since 2006 césar award for best animated film since 2011 golden rooster award for best animation since 1981 goya award for best animated film since 1989 japan academy prize for animation of the year since 2007 national film award for best animated film since 2006 also since 2007 the asia pacific screen award for best animated feature film has been awarded at the asia pacific screen awards since 2009 the european film awards have awarded the european film award for best animated film the annie award is another award presented for excellence in the field of animation unlike the academy awards the annie awards are only received for achievements in the field of animation and not for any other field of technical and artistic endeavor they were reorganized in 1992 to create a new field for best animated feature the 1990s winners were dominated by walt disney however newer studios led by pixar dreamworks have now begun to consistently vie for this award the list of awardees is as follows annie award for best animated feature annie award for best animated short subject annie award for best animated television production

27,shahre sūkhté iran a phenakistoscope disc by eadweard muybridge 1893 early examples of attempts to capture the phenomenon of motion into a still drawing can be found in paleolithic cave paintings where animals are often depicted with multiple legs in superimposed positions clearly attempting to convey the perception of motion a 5200year old pottery bowl discovered in shahre sukhteh iran has five sequential images painted around it that seem to show phases of a persian desert ibex leaping up to nip at a tree ancient chinese records contain several mentions of devices that were said to give an impression of movement to human or animal figures these accounts are unclear and may only refer to the actual movement of the figures through space they may of course refer to chinese shadow puppets in the 19th century the phenakistoscope 1832 zoetrope 1834 and praxinoscope 1877 were introduced a thaumatrope 1824 is a simple toy with a small disk with different pictures on each side a bird in a cage and is attached to two pieces of strings the phenakistoscope was invented simultaneously by belgian joseph plateau and austrian simon von stampfer in 1831 the phenakistoscope consists of a disk with a series of images drawn on radi evenly space around the center of the disk john barnes linnett patented the first flip book in 1868 as the kineograph the common flip book were early animation devices that produced an illusion of movement from a series of sequential drawings animation did not develop further until the advent of motion picture film and cinematography in the 1890s the cinématographe was a projector printer and camera in one machine that allowed moving pictures to be shown successfully on a screen which was invented by historys earliest filmmakers auguste and louis lumière in 1894 the first animated projection screening was created in france by charlesémile reynaud who was a french science teacher reynaud created the praxinoscope in 1877 and the théâtre optique in december 1888 on 28 october 1892 he projected the first animation in public pauvre pierrot at the musée grévin in paris this film is also notable as the first known instance of film perforations being used his films were not photographed they were drawn directly onto the transparent strip in 1900 more than 500000 people had attended these screenings a projecting praxinoscope 1882 here shown superimposing an animated figure on a separately projected background scene the first film that was recorded on standard picture film and included animated sequences was the 1900 enchanted drawing which was followed by the first entirely animated film the 1906 humorous phases of funny faces by j stuart blackton who because of that is considered the father of american animation traditional handdrawn animation the 1908 fantasmagorie by émile cohl pat sullivan for keen cartoon corporation in europe the french artist émile cohl created the first animated film using what came to be known as traditional animation creation methods the 1908 fantasmagorie the film largely consisted of a stick figure moving about and encountering all manner of morphing objects a wine bottle that transforms into a flower there were also sections of live action in which the animators hands would enter the scene the film was created by drawing each frame on paper and then shooting each frame onto negative film which gave the picture a blackboard look the author of the first puppetanimated film the beautiful lukanida 1912 was the russianborn ethnically polish director wladyslaw starewicz known as ladislas starevich more detailed handdrawn animation requiring a team of animators drawing each frame manually with detailed backgrounds and characters were those directed by winsor mccay a successful newspaper cartoonist including the 1911 little nemo the 1914 gertie the dinosaur and the 1918 the sinking of the lusitania gertie the dinosaur was an early example of the character development in drawn animation during the 1910s the production of animated short films typically referred to as cartoons became an industry of its own and cartoon shorts were produced for showing in movie theaters the most successful producer at the time was john randolph bray who along with animator earl hurd patented the cel animation process which dominated the animation industry for the rest of the decade italianargentine cartoonist quirino cristiani showing the cut and articulated figure of his satirical character el peludo based on president yrigoyen patented in 1916 for the realization of his movies including the worlds first animated feature film el apóstol el apóstol spanish the apostle was a 1917 argentine animated film utilizing cutout animation and the worlds first animated feature film unfortunately a fire that destroyed producer federico valles film studio incinerated the only known copy of el apóstol and it is now considered a lost film in 1958 hannabarbera released

27,traditional animation an example of traditional animation a horse animated by rotoscoping from eadweard muybridges 19thcentury photos traditional animation also called cel animation or handdrawn animation was the process used for most animated films of the 20th century the individual frames of a traditionally animated film are photographs of drawings first drawn on paper to create the illusion of movement each drawing differs slightly from the one before it the animators drawings are traced or photocopied onto transparent acetate sheets called cels which are filled in with paints in assigned colors or tones on the side opposite the line drawings the completed character cels are photographed onebyone against a painted background by a rostrum camera onto motion picture film the traditional cel animation process became obsolete by the beginning of the 21st century today animators drawings and the backgrounds are either scanned into or drawn directly into a computer system various software programs are used to color the drawings and simulate camera movement and effects the final animated piece is output to one of several delivery media including traditional 35 mm film and newer media with digital video the look of traditional cel animation is still preserved and the character animators work has remained essentially the same over the past 70 years some animation producers have used the term tradigital a play on the words traditional and digital to describe cel animation which makes extensive use of computer technologies examples of traditionally animated feature films include pinocchio united states 1940 animal farm united kingdom 1954 and the illusionist britishfrench 2010 traditionally animated films which were produced with the aid of computer technology include the lion king us 1994 the prince of egypt us 1998 akira japan 1988 spirited away japan 2001 the triplets of belleville france 2003 and the secret of kells irishfrenchbelgian 2009 full animation full animation refers to the process of producing highquality traditionally animated films that regularly use detailed drawings and plausible movement having a smooth animation fully animated films can be made in a variety of styles from more realistically animated works those produced by the walt disney studio the little mermaid beauty and the beast aladdin the lion king to the more cartoon styles of the warner bros animation studio many of the disney animated features are examples of full animation as are nondisney works the secret of nimh us 1982 the iron giant us 1999 and nocturna spain 2007 fully animated films are animated at 24 frames per second with a combination of animation on ones and twos meaning that drawings can be held for one frame out of 24 or two frames out of 24 limited animation limited animation involves the use of less detailed or more stylized drawings and methods of movement usually a choppy or skippy movement animation limited animation uses fewer drawings per second thereby limiting the fluidity of the animation this is a more economic technique pioneered by the artists at the american studio united productions of america limited animation can be used as a method of stylized artistic expression as in gerald mcboingboing us 1951 yellow submarine uk 1968 and certain anime produced in japan its primary use however has been in producing costeffective animated content for media for television the work of hannabarbera filmation and other tv animation studios and later the internet web cartoons rotoscoping rotoscoping is a technique patented by max fleischer in 1917 where animators trace liveaction movement frame by frame the source film can be directly copied from actors outlines into animated drawings as in the lord of the rings us 1978 or used in a stylized and expressive manner as in waking life us 2001 and a scanner darkly us 2006 some other examples are fire and ice us 1983 heavy metal 1981 and aku no hana 2013 liveactionanimation liveactionanimation is a technique combining handdrawn characters into live action shots or live action actors into animated shots one of the earlier uses was in koko the clown when koko was drawn over live action footage other examples include who framed roger rabbit us 1988 space jam us 1996 and osmosis jones us 2001 stop motion animation stopmotion animation is used to describe animation created by physically manipulating realworld objects and photographing them one frame of film at a time to create the illusion of movement there are many different types of stopmotion animation usually named after the medium used to create the animation computer software is widely available to create this type of animation however traditional stop motion animation is usually less expensive and timeconsuming to produce than current computer animation puppet animation typically involves stopmotion puppet figures interacting in a constructed environment in contrast to realworld interaction in model animation the puppets generally have an armature inside of them to keep them still and steady to constrain their motion to particular joints examples include the tale of the fox france 1937 the nightmare before christmas us 1993 corpse bride us 2005 coraline us 2009 the films of jiří trnka and the adult animated sketchcomedy television series robot chicken us 2005present puppetoon created using techniques developed by george pal are puppetanimated films which typically use a different version of a puppet for different frames rather than simply manipulating one existing puppet finnish television commercial clay animation or plasticine animation often called claymation which however is a trademarked name uses figures made of clay or a similar malleable material to create stopmotion animation the figures may have an armature or wire frame inside similar to the related puppet animation below that can be manipulated to pose the figures alternatively the figures may be made entirely of clay in the films of bruce bickford where clay creatures morph into a variety of different shapes examples of clayanimated works include the gumby show us 19571967 morph shorts uk 19772000 wallace and gromit shorts uk as of 1989 jan švankmajers dimensions of dialogue czechoslovakia 1982 the trap door uk 1984 films include wallace gromit the curse of the wererabbit chicken run and the adventures of mark twain stratacut animation stratacut animation is most commonly a form of clay animation in which a long breadlike loaf of clay internally packed tight and loaded with varying imagery is sliced into thin sheets with the animation camera taking a frame of the end of the loaf for each cut eventually revealing the movement of the internal images within cutout animation is a type of stopmotion animation produced by moving twodimensional pieces of material paper or cloth examples include terry gilliams animated sequences from monty pythons flying circus uk 19691974 fantastic planet franceczechoslovakia 1973 tale of tales russia 1979 the pilot episode of the adult television sitcom series and sometimes in episodes of south park us 1997 and the music video live for the moment from verona riots band produced by alberto serrano and nívola uyá spain 2014 silhouette animation is a variant of cutout animation in which the characters are backlit and only visible as silhouettes examples include the adventures of prince achmed weimar republic 1926 and princes et princesses france 2000 model animation refers to stopmotion animation created to interact with and exist as a part of a liveaction world intercutting matte effects and split screens are often employed to blend stopmotion characters or objects with live actors and settings examples include the work of ray harryhausen as seen in films jason and the argonauts 1963 and the work of willis h obrien on films king kong 1933 go motion is a variant of model animation that uses various techniques to create motion blur between frames of film which is not present in traditional stopmotion the technique was invented by industrial light magic and phil tippett to create special effect scenes for the film the empire strikes back 1980 another example is the dragon named vermithrax from dragonslayer 1981 film object animation refers to the use of regular inanimate objects in stopmotion animation as opposed to specially created items graphic animation uses nondrawn flat visual graphic material photographs newspaper clippings magazines etc which are sometimes manipulated framebyframe to create movement at other times the graphics remain stationary while the stopmotion camera is moved to create onscreen action brickfilm are a subgenre of object animation involving using lego or other similar brick toys to make an animation these have had a recent boost in popularity with the advent of video sharing sites youtube and the availability of cheap cameras and animation software pixilation involves the use of live humans as stop motion characters this allows for a number of surreal effects including disappearances and reappearances allowing people to appear to slide across the ground and other effects examples of pixilation include the secret adventures of tom thumb and angry kid shorts computer animation computer animation encompasses a variety of techniques the unifying factor being that the animation is created digitally on a computer 2d animation techniques tend to focus on image manipulation while 3d techniques usually build virtual worlds in which characters and objects move and interact 3d animation can create images that seem real to the viewer 2d animation a 2d animation of two circles joined by a chain 2d animation figures are created or edited on the computer using 2d bitmap graphics created and edited using with 2d vector graphics this includes automated computerized versions of traditional animation techniques interpolated morphing onion skinning and interpolated rotoscoping 2d animation has many applications including analog computer animation flash animation and powerpoint animation cinemagraphs are still photographs in the form of an animated gif file of which part is animated final line advection animation is a technique used in 2d animation to give artists and animators more influence and control over the final product as everything is done within the same department speaking about using this approach in paperman john kahrs said that our animators can change things actually erase away the cg underlayer if they want and change the profile of the arm 3d animation 3d animation is digitally modeled and manipulated by an animator the animator usually starts by creating a 3d polygon mesh to manipulate a mesh typically includes many vertices that are connected by edges and faces which give the visual appearance of form to a 3d object or 3d environment sometimes the mesh is given an internal digital skeletal structure called an armature that can be used to control the mesh by weighting the vertices this process is called rigging and can be used in conjunction with keyframes to create movement other techniques can be applied mathematical functions eg gravity particle simulations simulated fur or hair and effects fire and water simulations these techniques fall under the category of 3d dynamics 3d terms celshaded animation is used to mimic traditional animation using computer software shading looks stark with less blending of colors examples include skyland 2007 france the iron giant 1999 united states futurama fox 1999 appleseed ex machina 2007 japan the legend of zelda the wind waker 2002 japan machinima films created by screen capturing in video games and virtual worlds the term originated from the software introduction in the 1980s demoscene as well as the 1990s recordings of the firstperson shooter video game quake motion capture is used when liveaction actors wear special suits that allow computers to copy their movements into cg characters examples include polar express 2004 us beowulf 2007 us a christmas carol 2009 us the adventures of tintin film 2011 us kochadiiyan 2014 india photorealistic animation is used primarily for animation that attempts to resemble real life using advanced rendering that mimics in detail skin plants water fire clouds etc examples include up 2009 us how to train your dragon 2010 us ice age 2002 us mechanical animation animatronics is the use of mechatronics to create machines which seem animate rather than robotic audioanimatronics and autonomatronics is a form of robotics animation combined with 3d animation created by walt disney imagineering for shows and attractions at disney theme parks move and make noise generally a recorded speech or song they are fixed to whatever supports them they can sit and stand and they cannot walk an audioanimatron is different from an androidtype robot in that it uses prerecorded movements and sounds rather than responding to external stimuli in 2009 disney created an interactive version of the technology called autonomatronics linear animation generator is a form of animation by using static picture frames installed in a tunnel or a shaft the animation illusion is created by putting the viewer in a linear motion parallel to the installed picture frames the concept and the technical solution were invented in 2007 by mihai girlovan in romania chuckimation is a type of animation created by the makers of the television series action league now in which charactersprops are thrown or chucked from off camera or wiggled around to simulate talking by unseen hands puppetry is a form of theatre or performance animation that involves the manipulation of puppets it is very ancient and is believed to have originated 3000 years bc puppetry takes many forms they all share the process of animating inanimate performing objects puppetry is used in almost all human societies both as entertainment in performance and ceremonially in rituals celebrations and carnivals most puppetry involves storytelling toy story zoetrope at disney california adventure creates illusion of motion using figures rather than static pictures zoetrope is a device that produces the illusion of motion from a rapid succession of static pictures the term zoetrope is from the greek words ζωή zoē meaning alive active and τρόπος tropos meaning turn with zoetrope taken to mean active turn or wheel of life other animation styles techniques and approaches world of color hydrotechnics at disney california adventure creates illusion of motion using 1200 fountains with highdefinition projections on mist screens hydrotechnics a technique that includes lights water fire fog and lasers with highdefinition projections on mist screens drawn on film animation a technique where footage is produced by creating the images directly on film stock for example by norman mclaren len lye and stan brakhage paintonglass animation a technique for making animated films by manipulating slow drying oil paints on sheets of glass for example by aleksandr petrov erasure animation a technique using traditional 2d media photographed over time as the artist manipulates the image for example william kentridge is famous for his charcoal erasure films and piotr dumała for his auteur technique of animating scratches on plaster pinscreen animation makes use of a screen filled with movable pins that can be moved in or out by pressing an object onto the screen the screen is lit from

28,a lot of temples dedicated to apollo were built in greece and in the greek colonies and they show the spread of the cult of apollo and the evolution of the greek architecture which was mostly based on the rightness of form and on mathematical relations some of the earliest temples especially in crete dont belong to any greek order it seems that the first peripteral temples were rectangle wooden structures the different wooden elements were considered divine and their forms were preserved in the marble or stone elements of the temples of doric order the greeks used standard types because they believed that the world of objects was a series of typical forms which could be represented in several instances the temples should be canonic and the architects were trying to achieve the esthetic perfection from the earliest times there were certain rules strictly observed in rectangular peripteral and prostyle buildings the first buildings were narrow to hold the roof and when the dimensions changed some mathematical relations became necessary in order to keep the original forms this probably influenced the theory of numbers of pythagoras who believed that behind the appearance of things there was the permanent principle of mathematics the doric order dominated during the 6th and the 5th century bc but there was a mathematical problem regarding the position of the triglyphs which couldnt be solved without changing the original forms the order was almost abandoned for the ionic order but the ionic capital also posed an insoluble problem at the corner of a temple both orders were abandoned for the corinthian order gradually during the hellenistic age and under rome the most important temples are greek temples thebes greece the oldest temple probably dedicated to apollo

28,the louvre apollo sauroctonos roman copy after praxiteles 360 bc apollo is a common theme in greek and roman art and also in the art of the renaissance the earliest greek word for a statue is delight agalma and the sculptors tried to create forms which would inspire such guiding vision greek art puts into apollo the highest degree of power and beauty that can be imagined the sculptors derived this from observations on human beings but they also embodied in concrete form issues beyond the reach of ordinary thought the naked bodies of the statues are associated with the cult of the body that was essentially a religious activity the muscular frames and limbs combined with slim waists indicate the greek desire for health and the physical capacity which was necessary in the hard greek environment the statues of apollo embody beauty balance and inspire awe before the beauty of the world the evolution of the greek sculpture can be observed in his depictions from the almost static formal kouros type in early archaic period to the representation of motion in a relative harmonious whole in late archaic period in classical greece the emphasis is not given to the illusive imaginative reality represented by the ideal forms but to the analogies and the interaction of the members in the whole a method created by polykleitos finally praxiteles seems to be released from any art and religious conformities and his masterpieces are a mixture of naturalism with stylization art and greek philosophy the evolution of the greek art seems to go parallel with the greek philosophical conceptions which changed from the naturalphilosophy of thales to the metaphysical theory of pythagoras thales searched for a simple materialform directly perceptible by the senses behind the appearances of things and his theory is also related to the older animism this was paralleled in sculpture by the absolute representation of vigorous life through unnaturally simplified forms pythagoras believed that behind the appearance of things there was the permanent principle of mathematics and that the forms were based on a transcendental mathematical relation the forms on earth are imperfect imitations eikones images of the celestial world of numbers his ideas had a great influence on postarchaic art and the greek architects and sculptors were always trying to find the mathematical relation that would lead to the esthetic perfection canon in classical greece anaxagoras asserted that a divine reason mind gave order to the seeds of the universe and plato extended the greek belief of ideal forms to his metaphysical theory of forms ideai ideas the forms on earth are imperfect duplicates of the intellectual celestial ideas the greek words oida i know and eidos species a thing seen have the same root as the word idea a thing ἰδείν to see indicating how the greek mind moved from the gift of the senses to the principles beyond the senses the artists in platos time moved away from his theories and art tends to be a mixture of naturalism with stylization the greek sculptors considered the senses more important and the proportions were used to unite the sensible with the intellectual archaic sculpture kerameikos archaeological museum in athens kouros male youth is the modern term given to those representations of standing male youths which first appear in the archaic period in greece this type served certain religious needs and was first proposed for what was previously thought to be depictions of apollo the first statues are certainly still and formal the formality of their stance seems to be related with the egyptian precedent but it was accepted for a good reason the sculptors had a clear idea of what a young man is and embodied the archaic smile of good manners the firm and springy step the balance of the body dignity and youthful happiness when they tried to depict the most abiding qualities of men it was because men had common roots with the unchanging gods the adoption of a standard recognizable type for a long time is probably because nature gives preference in survival of a type which has long be adopted by the climatic conditions and also due to the general greek belief that nature expresses itself in ideal forms that can be imagined and represented these forms expressed immortality apollo was the immortal god of ideal balance and order his shrine in delphi that he shared in winter with dionysius had the inscriptions gnōthi seautónknow thyself and mēdén ágan nothing in excess and eggýa pára datē make a pledge and mischief is nigh new york kouros met mus 32111 marble 620610 bc metropolitan museum of art in the first largescale depictions during the early archaic period 640580 bc the artists tried to draw ones attention to look into the interior of the face and the body which were not represented as lifeless masses but as being full of life the greeks maintained until late in their civilization an almost animistic idea that the statues are in some sense alive this embodies the belief that the image was somehow the god or man himself a fine example is the statue of the sacred gate kouros which was found at the cemetery of dipylon in athens dipylon kouros the statue is the thing in itself and his slender face with the deep eyes express an intellectual eternity according to the greek tradition the dipylon master was named daedalus and in his statues the limbs were freed from the body giving the impression that the statues could move it is considered that he created also the new york kouros which is the oldest fully preserved statue of kouros type and seems to be the incarnation of the god himself piraeus apollo archaicstyle bronze archaeological museum of piraeus the animistic idea as the representation of the imaginative reality is sanctified in the homeric poems and in greek myths in stories of the god hephaestus phaistos and the mythic daedalus the builder of the labyrinth that made images which moved of their own accord this kind of art goes back to the minoan period when its main theme was the representation of motion in a specific moment these freestanding statues were usually marble but also the form rendered in limestone bronze ivory and terracotta the earliest examples of lifesized statues of apollo may be two figures from the ionic sanctuary on the island of delos such statues were found across the greek speaking world the preponderance of these were found at the sanctuaries of apollo with more than one hundred from the sanctuary of apollo ptoios boeotia alone the last stage in the development of the kouros type is the late archaic period 520485 bc in which the greek sculpture attained a full knowledge of human anatomy and used to create a relative harmonious whole ranking from the very few bronzes survived to us is the masterpiece bronze piraeus apollo it was found in piraeus the harbour of athens the statue originally held the bow in its left hand and a cup of pouring libation in its right hand it probably comes from northeastern peloponnesus the emphasis is given in anatomy and it is one of the first attempts to represent a kind of motion and beauty relative to proportions which appear mostly in postarchaic art the statue throws some light on an artistic centre which with an independently developed harder simpler and heavier style restricts ionian influence in athens finally this is the germ from which the art of polykleitos was to grow two or three generations later classical sculpture apollo of the mantoua type marble roman copy after a 5thcentury bce greek original attributed to polykleitos musée du louvre in the next century which is the beginning of the classical period it was considered that beauty in visible things as in everything else consisted of symmetry and proportions the artists tried also to represent motion in a specific moment myron which may be considered as the reappearance of the dormant minoan element anatomy and geometry are fused in one and each does something to the other the greek sculptors tried to clarify it by looking for mathematical proportions just as they sought some reality behind appearances polykleitos in his canon wrote that beauty consists in the proportion not of the elements materials but of the parts that is the interrelation of parts with one another and with the whole it seems that he was influenced by the theories of pythagoras the famous apollo of mantua and its variants are early forms of the apollo citharoedus statue type in which the god holds the cithara in his left arm the type is represented by neoattic imperial roman copies of the late 1st or early 2nd century modelled upon a supposed greek bronze original made in the second quarter of the 5th century bce in a style similar to works of polykleitos but more archaic the apollo held the cythara against his extended left arm of which in the louvre example a fragment of one twisting scrolling horn upright remains against his biceps though the proportions were always important in greek art the appeal of the greek sculptures eludes any explanation by proportion alone the statues of apollo were thought to incarnate his living presence and these representations of illusive imaginative reality had deep roots in the minoan period and in the beliefs of the first greek speaking people who entered the region during the bronzeage just as the greeks saw the mountains forests sea and rivers as inhabited by concrete beings so nature in all of its manifestations possesses clear form and the form of a work of art spiritual life is incorporated in matter when it is given artistic form just as in the arts the greeks sought some reality behind appearances so in mathematics they sought permanent principles which could be applied wherever the conditions were the same artists and sculptors tried to find this ideal order in relation with mathematics but they believed that this ideal order revealed itself not so much to the dispassionate intellect as to the whole sentient self things as we see them and as they really are are one that each stresses the nature of the other in a single unity pediments and friezes temple of zeus olympia greece in the archaic pediments and friezes of the temples the artists had a problem to fit a group of figures into an isosceles triangle with acute angles at the base the siphnian treasury in delphi was one of the first greek buildings utilizing the solution to put the dominating form in the middle and to complete the descending scale of height with other figures sitting or kneeling the pediment shows the story of heracles stealing apollos tripod that was strongly associated with his oracular inspiration their two figures hold the centre in the pediment of the temple of zeus in olympia the single figure of apollo is dominating the scene part of the bassae frieze at the british museum apollo and artemis in the northeast corner head of the apollo belvedere these representations rely on presenting scenes directly to the eye for their own visible sake they care for the schematic arrangements of bodies in space but only as parts in a larger whole while each scene has its own character and completeness it must fit into the general sequence to which it belongs in these archaic pediments the sculptors use empty intervals to suggest a passage to and fro a busy battlefield the artists seem to have been dominated by geometrical pattern and order and this was improved when classical art brought a greater freedom and economy hellenistic greecerome apollo as a handsome beardless young man is often depicted with a kithara as apollo citharoedus or bow in his hand or reclining on a tree the apollo lykeios and apollo sauroctonos types the apollo belvedere is a marble sculpture that was rediscovered in the late 15th century for centuries it epitomized the ideals of classical antiquity for europeans from the renaissance through the 19th century the marble is a hellenistic or roman copy of a bronze original by the greek sculptor leochares made between 350 and 325

chryseis had been captured he demanded her return and the achaeans complied indirectly causing the anger of achilles which is the theme of the iliad in the iliad when diomedes injured aeneas apollo rescued him first aphrodite tried to rescue aeneas but diomedes injured her as well aeneas was then enveloped in a cloud by apollo who took him to pergamos a sacred spot in troy apollo aided paris in the killing of achilles by guiding the arrow of his bow into achilles heel one interpretation of his motive is that it was in revenge for achilles sacrilege in murdering troilus the gods own son by hecuba on the very altar of the gods own temple admetus when zeus struck down apollos son asclepius with a lightning bolt for resurrecting hippolytus from the dead transgressing themis by stealing hadess subjects apollo in revenge killed the cyclopes who had fashioned the bolt for zeus apollo would have been banished to tartarus forever for this but was instead sentenced to one year of hard labor due to the intercession of his mother leto during this time he served as shepherd for king admetus of pherae in thessaly admetus treated apollo well and in return the god conferred great benefits on admetus apollo helped admetus win alcestis the daughter of king pelias and later convinced the fates to let admetus live past his time if another took his place but when it came time for admetus to die his parents whom he had assumed would gladly die for him refused to cooperate instead alcestis took his place but heracles managed to persuade thanatos the god of death to return her to

superiority to leto because she had fourteen children niobids seven male and seven female while leto had only two apollo killed her sons and artemis her daughters apollo and artemis used poisoned arrows to kill them though according to some versions of the myth a number of the niobids were spared chloris usually amphion at the sight of his dead sons either killed himself or was killed by apollo after swearing revenge a devastated niobe fled to mount sipylos in asia minor and turned into stone as she wept her tears formed the river achelous zeus had turned all the people of thebes to stone and so no one buried the niobids until the ninth day after their death when the gods themselves entombed them consorts and children love affairs ascribed to apollo are a late development in greek mythology their vivid anecdotal qualities have made some of them favorites of painters since the renaissance the result being that they stand out more prominently in the modern imagination female lovers apollo and daphne by bernini in the galleria borghese daphne was a nymph daughter of the river god peneus who had scorned apollo the myth explains the connection of apollo with δάφνη daphnē the laurel whose leaves his priestess employed at delphi in ovids metamorphoses phoebus apollo chaffs cupid for toying with a weapon more suited to a man whereupon cupid wounds him with a golden dart simultaneously however cupid shoots a leaden arrow into daphne causing her to be repulsed by apollo following a spirited chase by apollo daphne prays to her father peneus for help and he

buried alive apollo refused to forgive clytia for betraying his beloved and a grieving clytia wilted and slowly died apollo changed her into an incense plant either heliotrope or sunflower which follows the sun every day marpessa was kidnapped by idas but was loved by apollo as well zeus made her choose between them and she chose idas on the grounds that apollo being immortal would tire of her when she grew old castalia was a nymph whom apollo loved she fled from him and dove into the spring at delphi at the base of mt parnassos which was then named after her water from this spring was sacred it was used to clean the delphian temples and inspire the priestesses in the last oracle is mentioned that the water which could speak has been lost for ever by cyrene apollo had a son named aristaeus who became the patron god of cattle fruit trees hunting husbandry and beekeeping he was also a culturehero and taught humanity dairy skills the use of nets and traps in hunting and how to cultivate olives hecuba was the wife of king priam of troy and apollo had a son with her named troilus an oracle prophesied that troy would not be defeated as long as troilus reached the age of twenty alive he was ambushed and killed by achilleus cassandra was daughter of hecuba and priam and troilus halfsister apollo fell in love with cassandra and promised her the gift of prophecy to seduce her but she rejected him afterwards enraged apollo indeed gave her the ability to know the future with a curse that she could only see the future tragedies and that no one would ever believe her coronis was daughter of phlegyas king of the lapiths pregnant with asclepius coronis fell in love with ischys son of elatus a crow informed apollo of the affair when first informed he disbelieved the crow and turned all crows black where they were previously white as a punishment for spreading untruths when he found out the truth he sent his sister artemis to kill coronis in other stories apollo himself had killed coronis as a result he also made the crow sacred and gave them the task of announcing important deaths apollo rescued the baby and gave it to the centaur chiron to raise phlegyas was irate

caraglio hyacinth or hyacinthus was one of apollos male lovers he was a spartan prince beautiful and athletic the pair was practicing throwing the discus when a discus thrown by apollo was blown off course by the jealous zephyrus and struck hyacinthus in the head killing him instantly apollo is said to be filled with grief out of hyacinthus blood apollo created a flower named after him as a memorial to his death and his tears stained the flower petals with the interjection meaning alas the festival of hyacinthus was a celebration of sparta another male lover was cyparissus a descendant of heracles apollo gave him a tame deer as a companion but cyparissus accidentally killed it with a javelin as it lay asleep in the undergrowth cyparissus asked apollo to let his tears fall forever apollo granted the request by turning him into the cypress named after him which was said to be a sad tree because the sap forms droplets like tears on the trunk other male lovers of apollo include admetus atymnius otherwise known as a beloved of sarpedon branchus alternately a son of apollo carnus clarus hippolytus of sicyon not the same as hippolytus the son of theseus hymenaios iapis leucates who threw himself off a rock when apollo attempted to carry him off phorbas probably the son of triopas potnieus apollos lyre apollo with his lyre statue from pergamon museum berlin hermes was born on mount cyllene in arcadia the story is told in the homeric hymn to hermes his mother maia had been secretly impregnated by zeus maia wrapped the infant in blankets but hermes escaped while she was asleep hermes ran to thessaly where apollo was grazing his cattle the infant hermes stole a number of his cows and took them to a cave in the woods near pylos covering their tracks in the cave he found a tortoise and killed it then removed the insides he used one of the cows intestines and the tortoise shell and made the first lyre apollo complained to maia that her son had stolen his cattle but hermes had already replaced himself in the blankets she had wrapped him in so maia refused to believe apollos claim zeus intervened and claiming to have seen the events sided with apollo hermes then began to play music on the lyre he had invented apollo a god of music fell in love with the instrument and offered to allow exchange of the cattle for the lyre hence apollo then became a master of the lyre apollo in the oresteia in aeschylus oresteia trilogy clytemnestra kills her husband king agamemnon because he had sacrificed their daughter iphigenia to proceed forward with the trojan war and cassandra a prophetess of apollo apollo gives an order through the oracle at delphi that agamemnons son orestes is to kill clytemnestra and aegisthus her lover orestes and pylades carry out the revenge and consequently orestes is pursued by the erinyes or furies female personifications of vengeance apollo and the furies argue about whether the matricide was justified apollo holds that the bond of marriage is sacred and orestes was avenging his father whereas the erinyes say that the bond of blood between mother and son is more meaningful than the bond of marriage they invade his temple and he says that the matter should be brought before athena apollo promises to protect orestes as orestes has become apollos supplicant apollo advocates orestes at the trial and ultimately athena rules in favor of apollo other stories apollo killed the aloadae when they attempted to storm mt olympus callimachus sang that apollo rode on the back of a swan to the land of the hyperboreans during the winter months apollo turned cephissus into a sea monster another contender for the birthplace of apollo is the cretan islands of paximadia musical contests pan once pan had the audacity to compare his music with that of apollo and to challenge apollo the god of the kithara the mountaingod tmolus was chosen to umpire pan blew on his pipes and with his rustic melody gave great satisfaction to himself and his faithful follower midas who happened to be present then apollo struck the strings of his lyre tmolus at once awarded the victory to apollo and all but midas agreed with the judgment he dissented and questioned the justice of the award apollo would not suffer such a depraved pair of ears any longer and caused them to become the ears of a donkey marsyas marsyas under apollos punishment istanbul archaeology museum apollo has ominous aspects aside from his plaguebringing deathdealing arrows marsyas was a satyr who challenged apollo to a contest of music he had found an aulos on the ground tossed away after being invented by athena because it made her cheeks puffy the contest was judged by the muses after they each performed both were deemed equal until apollo decreed they play and sing at the same time as apollo played the lyre this was easy to do marsyas could not do this as he only knew how to use the flute and could not sing at the same time apollo was declared the winner because of this apollo flayed marsyas alive in a cave near celaenae in phrygia for his hubris to challenge a god he then nailed marsyas shaggy skin to a nearby pinetree marsyas blood turned into the river marsyas another variation is that apollo played his instrument the lyre upside down marsyas could not do this with his instrument the flute and so apollo hung him from a tree and flayed him alive cinyras apollo also had a lyreplaying contest with cinyras his son who committed suicide when he lost head of apollo marble roman copy of a greek original of the 4th century bce from the collection of cardinal albani roman apollo the roman worship of apollo was adopted from the greeks as a quintessentially greek god apollo had no direct roman equivalent although later roman poets often referred to him as phoebus there was a tradition that the delphic oracle was consulted as early as the period of the kings of rome during the reign of tarquinius superbus on the occasion of a pestilence in the 430s bce apollos first temple at rome was established in the flaminian fields replacing an older cult site there known as the apollinare during the second punic war in 212 bce the ludi apollinares apollonian games were instituted in his honor on the instructions of a prophecy attributed to one marcius in the time of augustus who considered himself under the special protection of apollo and was even said to be his son his worship developed and he became one of the chief gods of rome after the battle of actium which was fought near a sanctuary of apollo augustus enlarged apollos temple dedicated a portion of the spoils to him and instituted quinquennial games in his honour he also erected a new temple to the god on the palatine hill sacrifices and prayers on the palatine to apollo and diana formed the culmination of the secular games held in 17 bce to celebrate the dawn of a new era

28,apollo seated with lyre porphyry and marble 2nd century ad farnese collection naples italy the name apollounlike the related older name paeanis generally not found in the linear b mycenean greek texts although there is a possible attestation in the lacunose form perjo linear b on the kn e 842 tablet the etymology of the name is uncertain the spelling in classical attic had almost superseded all other forms by the beginning of the common era but the doric form apellon is more archaic as it is derived from an earlier it probably is a cognate to the doric month apellaios and the offerings apellaia at the initiation of the young men during the familyfestival apellai according to some scholars the words are derived from the doric word apella which originally meant wall fence for animals and later assembly within the limits of the square apella is the name of the popular assembly in sparta corresponding to the ecclesia r s p beekes rejected the connection of the theonym with the noun apellai and suggested a pregreek protoform apalyun several instances of popular etymology are attested from ancient authors thus the greeks most often associated apollos name with the greek verb apollymi to destroy plato in cratylus connects the name with apolysis redemption with apolousis purification and with haploun simple in particular in reference to the thessalian form of the name and finally with aeiballon evershooting hesychius connects the name apollo with the doric apella which means assembly so that apollo would be the god of political life and he also gives the explanation sekos fold in which case apollo would be the god of flocks and herds in the ancient macedonian language pella means stone and some toponyms may be derived from this word pella the capital of ancient macedonia and pellēnēpallene a number of nongreek etymologies have been suggested for the name the hittite form apaliunas d is attested in the manapatarhunta letter perhaps related to hurrian and certainly the etruscan aplu a god of plague in turn likely from akkadian aplu enlil meaning simply the son of enlil a title that was given to the god nergal who was linked to shamash babylonian god of the sun the role of apollo as god of plague is evident in the invocation of apollo smintheus mouse apollo by chryses the trojan priest of apollo with the purpose of sending a plague against the greeks the reasoning behind a god of the plague becoming a god of healing is of course apotropaic meaning that the god responsible for bringing the plague must be appeased in order to remove the plague the hittite testimony reflects an early form which may also be surmised from comparison of cypriot with doric a luwian etymology suggested for apaliunas makes apollo the one of entrapment perhaps in the sense of hunter grecoroman epithets apollos chief epithet was phoebus phoibos literally bright it was very commonly used by both the greeks and romans for apollos role as the god of light like other

28,the omphalos in the museum of delphi the cult centers of apollo in greece delphi and delos date from the 8th century bce the delos sanctuary was primarily dedicated to artemis apollos twin sister at delphi apollo was venerated as the slayer of pytho for the greeks apollo was all the gods in one and through the centuries he acquired different functions which could originate from different gods in archaic greece he was the prophet the oracular god who in older times was connected with healing in classical greece he was the god of light and of music but in popular religion he had a strong function to keep away evil walter burkert discerned three components in the prehistory of apollo worship which he termed a doriannorthwest greek component a cretanminoan component and a syrohittite component from his eastern origin apollo brought the art of inspection of symbols and omina σημεία και τέρατα semeia kai terata and of the observation of the omens of the days the inspiration oracularcult was probably introduced from anatolia the ritualism belonged to apollo from the beginning the greeks created the legalism the supervision of the orders of the gods and the demand for moderation and harmony apollo became the god of shining youth the protector of music spirituallife moderation and perceptible order the improvement of the old anatolian god and his elevation to an intellectual sphere may be considered an achievement of the greek people healer and godprotector from evil the function of apollo as a healer is connected with paean the physician of the gods in the iliad who seems to come from a more primitive religion paeοn is probably connected with the mycenean pajawone linear b but this is not certain he did not have a separate cult but he was the personification of the holy magicsong sung by the magicians that was supposed to cure disease later the greeks knew the original meaning of the relevant song paean the magicians were also called seerdoctors and they used an ecstatic prophetic art which was used exactly by the god apollo at the oracles in the iliad apollo is the healer under the gods but he is also the bringer of disease and death with his arrows similar to the function of the vedic god of disease rudra he sends a plague to the achaeans the god who sends a disease can also prevent it therefore when it stops they make a purifying ceremony and offer him a hecatomb to ward off evil when the oath of his priest appeases they pray and with a song they call their own god the paean some common epithets of apollo as a healer are paion literally healer or helper epikourios help oulios healed wound also a scar and loimios plague in classical times his strong function in popular religion was to keep away evil and was therefore called apotropaios divert deter avert and alexikakos from v n defend from evil in later writers the word usually spelled paean becomes a mere epithet of apollo in his capacity as a god of healing homer illustrated paeon the god and the song both of apotropaic thanksgiving or triumph such songs were originally addressed to apollo and afterwards to other gods to dionysus to apollo helios to apollos son asclepius the healer about the 4th century bce the paean became merely a formula of adulation its object was either to implore protection against disease and misfortune or to offer thanks after such protection had been rendered it was in this way that apollo had become recognised as the god of music apollos role as the slayer of the python led to his association with battle and victory hence it became the roman custom for a paean to be sung by an army on the march and before entering into battle when a fleet left the harbour and also after a victory had been won dorian origin apollo victorious over the python by the florentine pietro francavilla dated 1591 depicting apollos first triumph when he slew with his bow and arrows the serpent python which lies dead at his feet the walters art museum the connection with the dorians and their initiation festival apellai is reinforced by the month apellaios in northwest greek calendars the familyfestival was dedicated to apollo doric apellaios is the month of these rites and apellon is the megistos kouros the great kouros however it can explain only the doric type of the name which is connected with the ancient macedonian word pella pella stone stones played an important part in the cult of the god especially in the oracular shrine of delphi omphalos the homeric hymn represents apollo as a northern intruder his arrival must have occurred during the dark ages that followed the destruction of the mycenaean civilization and his conflict with gaia mother earth was represented by the legend of his slaying her daughter the serpent python the earth deity had power over the ghostly world and it is believed that she was the deity behind the oracle the older tales mentioned two dragons who were perhaps intentionally conflated a female dragon named delphyne womb and a male serpent typhon to smoke the adversary of zeus in the titanomachy who the narrators confused with python python was the good daemon ἀγαθὸς δαίμων of the temple as it appears in minoan religion but she was represented as a dragon as often happens in northern european folklore as well as in the east apollo and his sister artemis can bring death with their arrows the conception that diseases and death come from invisible shots sent by supernatural beings or magicians is common in germanic and norse mythology in greek mythology artemis was the leader hegemon of the nymphs who had similar functions with the nordic elves the elfshot originally indicated disease or death attributed to the elves but it was later attested denoting stone arrowheads which were used by witches to harm people and also for healing rituals the vedic rudra has some similar functions with apollo the terrible god is called the archer and the bow is also an attribute of shiva rudra could bring diseases with his arrows but he was able to free people of them and his alternative shiba is a healer physician god however the indoeuropean component of apollo does not explain his strong relation with omens exorcisms and with the oracular cult minoan origin minoan labrys it seems an oracular cult existed in delphi from the mycenaean age in historical times the priests of delphi were called labryaden the doubleaxe men which indicates minoan origin the doubleaxe labrys was the holy symbol of the cretan labyrinth the homeric hymn adds that apollo appeared as a dolphin and carried cretan priests to delphi where they evidently transferred their religious practices apollo delphinios or delphidios was a seagod especially worshiped in crete and in the islands apollos sister artemis who was the greek goddess of hunting is identified with britomartis diktynna the minoan mistress of the animals in her earliest depictions she is accompanied by the mister of the animals a male god of hunting who had the bow as his attribute his original name is unknown but it seems that he was absorbed by the more popular apollo who stood by the virgin mistress of the animals becoming her brother the old oracles in delphi seem to be connected with a local tradition of the priesthood and there is not clear evidence that a kind of inspirationprophecy existed in the temple this led some scholars to the conclusion that pythia carried on the rituals in a consistent procedure through many centuries according to the local tradition in that regard the mythical seeress sibyl of anatolian origin with her ecstatic art looks unrelated to the oracle itself however the greek tradition is referring to the existence of vapours and chewing of laurelleaves which seem to be confirmed by recent studies plato describes the priestesses of delphi and dodona as frenzied women obsessed by mania frenzy a greek word he connected with mantis prophet frenzied women like sibyls from whose lips the god speaks are recorded in the near east as mari in the second millennium bc although crete had contacts with mari from 2000 bc there is no evidence that the ecstatic prophetic art existed during the minoan and mycenean ages it is more probable that this art was introduced later from anatolia and regenerated an existing oracular cult that was local to delphi and dormant in several areas of greece anatolian origin illustration of a coin of apollo agyieus from ambracia a nongreek origin of apollo has long been assumed in scholarship the name of apollos mother leto has lydian origin and she was worshipped on the coasts of asia minor the inspiration oracular cult was probably introduced into greece from anatolia which is the origin of sibyl and where existed some of the oldest oracular shrines omens symbols purifications and exorcisms appear in old assyrobabylonian texts and these rituals were spread into the empire of the hittites in a hittite text is mentioned that the king invited a babylonian priestess for a certain purification a similar story is mentioned by plutarch he writes that the cretan seer epimenides purified athens after the pollution brought by the alcmeonidae and that the seers expertise in sacrifices and reform of funeral practices were of great help to solon in his reform of the athenian state the story indicates that epimenides was probably heir to the shamanic religions of asia and proves together with the homeric hymn that crete had a resisting religion up to historical times it seems that these rituals were dormant in greece and they were reinforced when the greeks migrated to anatolia homer pictures apollo on the side of the trojans fighting against the achaeans during the trojan war he is pictured as a terrible god less trusted by the greeks than other gods the god seems to be related to appaliunas a tutelary god of wilusa troy in asia minor but the word is not complete the stones found in front of the gates of homeric troy were the symbols of apollo the greeks gave to him the name agyieus as the protector god of public places and houses who wards off evil and his symbol was a tapered stone or column however while usually greek festivals were celebrated at the full moon all the feasts of apollo were celebrated at the seventh day of the month and the emphasis given to that day sibutu indicates a babylonian origin the late bronze age from 1700 to 1200 bce hittite and hurrian aplu was a god of plague invoked during plague years here we have an apotropaic situation where a god originally bringing the plague was invoked to end it aplu meaning the son of was a title given to the god nergal who was linked to the babylonian god of the sun shamash homer interprets apollo as a terrible god who brings death and disease with his arrows but who can also heal possessing a magic art that separates him from the other greek gods in iliad his priest prays to apollo smintheus the mouse god who retains an older agricultural function as the protector from field rats all these functions including the function of the healergod paean who seems to have mycenean origin are fused in the cult of apollo

29,early in his career agassi would look to end points quickly by playing firststrike tennis typically by inducing a weak return with a deep hard shot and then playing a winner at an extreme angle his groundstrokes return of serve baseline game anticipation and eyehand coordination were always among the best in the game on the rare occasion that he charged the net agassi liked to take the ball in the air and hit a swinging volley for the winner his favored groundstroke was his flat accurate twohanded backhand hit well crosscourt but in particular down the line his forehand was nearly as strong in particular his insideout forehand to the ad court agassis strength was in dictating play from the back of the court while he was growing up his father and nick bollettieri trained him in this way when in control of a point agassi would often pass up an opportunity to attempt a winner and hit a conservative shot to minimize his errors and to make his opponent run more this change to more methodical less aggressive baseline play was largely initiated by his longtime coach brad gilbert in their first year together in 1994 gilbert encouraged agassi to wear out opponents with his deep flat groundstrokes and to use his fitness to win attrition wars and noted agassis twohanded backhand down the line as his very best shot a signature play later in his career was a change up drop shot to the deuce court after deep penetrating groundstrokes this would often be followed by a passing shot or lob if the opponent was fast enough to retrieve it agassi was raised on hardcourts but found much of his early majortournament success on the red clay of roland garros reaching two consecutive finals there early in his career despite grass being his worst surface his first major win was at the slick grass of wimbledon in 1992 a tournament that he professed to hating at the time his strongest surface over the course of his career was indeed hardcourt where he won six of his eight majors

30,linguists traditionally recognize two primary divisions of austroasiatic the monkhmer languages of southeast asia northeast india and the nicobar islands and the munda languages of east and central india and parts of bangladesh however no evidence for this classification has ever been published each of the families that is written in boldface type below is accepted as a valid clade by contrast the relationships between these families within austroasiatic is debated in addition to the traditional classification two recent proposals are given neither of which accept traditional monkhmer as a valid unit however little of the data used for competing classifications has ever been published and therefore cannot be evaluated by peer review in addition there are suggestions that additional

o2a1m95 speaking this language can be seen in this link other geneticists criticise the zhivotovsky method previously existent branches roger blench 2009 also proposes that there might have been other primary branches of austroasiatic that are now extinct based on substrate evidence in modernday languages prechamic languages the languages of coastal vietnam prior to the chamic migrations chamic has various austroasiatic loanwords that cannot be clearly traced to existing austroasiatic branches sidwell 2006 acehnese substratum sidwell 2006 acehnese has many basic words that are of austroasiatic origin suggesting that either austronesian speakers have absorbed earlier austroasiatic residents in northern sumatra or that words might have been borrowed from austroasiatic languages in southern vietnam or perhaps a combination of both bornean substrate languages blench 2010 blench cites austroasiaticorigin words in modernday bornean branches such as land dayak bidayuh dayak bakatiq etc dusunic central dusun visayan etc kayan and kenyah noting especially resemblances with aslian as further evidence for his proposal blench also cites ethnographic evidence such as musical instruments in borneo shared in common with austroasiaticspeaking groups in mainland southeast asia lepcha substratum rongic many words of austroasiatic origin have been noticed in lepcha suggesting a sinotibetan superstrate laid over an austroasiatic substrate blench 2013 calls this branch rongic based on the lepcha autonym róng other languages with proposed austroasiatic substrata are jiamao based on evidence from the register system of jiamao a hlai language thurgood 1992 jiamao is known for its highly aberrant vocabulary sidwell 2009 2011 paul sidwell and roger blench propose that the austroasiatic phylum had dispersed via the mekong river drainage basin paul sidwell 2009a in a lexicostatistical comparison of 36 languages which are wellknown enough to exclude loan words finds little evidence for internal branching though he did find an area of increased contact between the bahnaric and katuic languages such that languages of all branches apart from the geographically distant munda and nicobarese show greater similarity to bahnaric and katuic the closer they are to those branches without any noticeable innovations common to bahnaric and katuic he therefore takes the conservative view that the thirteen branches of austroasiatic should be treated as equidistant on current evidence sidwell blench 2011 discuss this proposal in more detail and note that there is good evidence for a khasipalaungic node which could also possibly be closely related to khmuic if this would the case sidwell blench suggest that khasic may have been an early offshoot of palaungic that had spread westward sidwell blench 2011 suggest shompen as an additional branch and believe that a vietokatuic connection is worth investigating in general however the family is thought to have diversified too quickly for a deeply nested structure to have developed since protoaustroasiatic speakers are believed by sidwell to have radiated out from the central mekong river valley relatively quickly

30,regarding word structure austroasiatic languages are well known for having an iambic sesquisyllabic pattern with basic nouns and verbs consisting of an initial unstressed reduced minor syllable followed by a stressed full syllable this reduction of presyllables has led to a variety among modern languages of phonological shapes of the same original protoaustroasiatic prefixes such as the causative prefix ranging from cvc syllables to consonant clusters to single consonants as for word formation most austroasiatic languages have a variety of derivational prefixes many have infixes but suffixes are almost completely nonexistent in most branches except munda and a few specialized exceptions in other austroasiatic branches the austroasiatic languages are further characterized as having unusually large vowel inventories and employing some sort of register contrast either between modal normal voice and breathy lax voice or between modal voice and creaky voice languages in the pearic branch and some in the vietic branch can have a three or even fourway voicing contrast however some austroasiatic languages have lost the register contrast by evolving more diphthongs or in a few cases such as vietnamese tonogenesis vietnamese has been so heavily influenced by chinese that its original austroasiatic phonological quality is obscured and now resembles that of south chinese languages whereas khmer which had more influence from sanskrit has retained a more typically austroasiatic structure

31,during the early 1800s linguists grouped the berber cushitic and egyptian languages within a hamitic phylum in acknowledgement of these languages genetic relation with each other and with those in the semitic phylum the terms hamitic and semitic were etymologically derived from the book of genesis which describes various biblical tribes descended from ham and shem two sons of noah by the 1860s the main constituent elements within the broader afroasiatic family had been worked out the scholar friedrich müller introduced the name hamitosemitic for the entire family in his grundriss der sprachwissenschaft 1876 maurice delafosse 1914 later coined the term afroasiatic often now spelled afroasiatic however it did not come into general use until joseph greenberg 1950 formally proposed its adoption in doing so greenberg sought to emphasize the fact that afroasiatic spanned the continents of both africa and asia individual scholars have also called the family erythraean tucker 1966 and lisramic hodge 1972 in lieu of hamitosemitic the russian linguist igor diakonoff later suggested the term afrasian meaning half african half asiatic in reference to the geographic distribution of the familys constituent languages the term hamitosemitic remains in use in the academic traditions of some european countries

31,interrelations between branches of afroasiatic lipiński 2001 some linguists proposals for grouping within afroasiatic the afroasiatic language family is usually considered to include the following branches berber chadic cushitic egyptian omotic semitic although there is general agreement on these six families there are some points of disagreement among linguists who study afroasiatic in particular the omotic language branch is the most controversial member of afroasiatic because the grammatical formatives that most linguists have given greatest weight in classifying languages in the family are either absent or distinctly wobbly hayward 1995 greenberg 1963 and others considered it a subgroup of cushitic whereas others have raised doubts about it being part of afroasiatic at all eg theil 2006 the afroasiatic identity of ongota is also broadly questioned as is its position within afroasiatic among those who accept it due to the mixed appearance of the language and a paucity of research and data harold fleming 2006 proposes that ongota constitutes a separate branch of afroasiatic bonny sands 2009 believes the most convincing proposal is by savà and tosco 2003 namely that ongota is an east cushitic language with a nilosaharan substratum in other words it would appear that the ongota people once spoke a nilosaharan language but then shifted to speaking a cushitic language but retained some characteristics of their earlier nilosaharan language beja is sometimes listed as a separate branch of afroasiatic but is more often included in the cushitic branch which has a high degree of internal diversity whether the various branches of cushitic actually form a language family is sometimes questioned but not their inclusion in afroasiatic itself there is no consensus on the interrelationships of the five nonomotic branches of afroasiatic see subgrouping below this situation is not unusual even among longestablished language families there are also many disagreements concerning the internal classification of the indoeuropean languages for instance meroitic has been proposed as an unclassified afroasiatic language because it shares the phonotactics characteristic of the family but there is not enough evidence to secure a classification classification history in the 9th century the hebrew grammarian judah ibn quraysh of tiaret in algeria was the first to link two branches of afroasiatic together he perceived a relationship between berber and semitic he knew of semitic through his study of arabic hebrew and aramaic in the course of the 19th century europeans also began suggesting such relationships in 1844 theodor benfey suggested a language family consisting of semitic berber and cushitic calling the latter ethiopic in the same year tn newman suggested a relationship between semitic and hausa but this would long remain a topic of dispute and uncertainty friedrich müller named the traditional hamitosemitic family in 1876 in his grundriss der sprachwissenschaft outline of linguistics and defined it as consisting of a semitic group plus a hamitic group containing egyptian berber and cushitic he excluded the chadic group it was the egyptologist karl richard lepsius 18101884 who restricted hamitic to the nonsemitic languages in africa which are characterized by a grammatical gender system this hamitic language group was proposed to unite various mainly northafrican languages including the ancient egyptian language the berber languages the cushitic languages the beja language and the chadic languages unlike müller lepsius considered that hausa and nama were part of the hamitic group these classifications relied in part on nonlinguistic anthropological and racial arguments both authors used the skincolor mode of subsistence and other characteristics of native speakers as part of their arguments that particular languages should be grouped together distribution of the afroasiatichamitosemitic languages in africa library of congress in 1912 carl meinhof published die sprachen der hamiten the languages of the hamites in which he expanded lepsiuss model adding the fula maasai bari nandi sandawe and hadza languages to the hamitic group meinhofs model was widely supported into the 1940s meinhofs system of classification of the hamitic languages was based on a belief that speakers of hamitic became largely coterminous with cattle herding peoples with essentially caucasian origins intrinsically different from and superior to the negroes of africa but in the case of the socalled nilohamitic languages a concept he introduced it was based on the typological feature of gender and a fallacious theory of language mixture meinhof did this although earlier work by scholars such as lepsius and johnston had substantiated that the languages which he would later dub nilohamitic were in fact nilotic languages with numerous similarities in vocabulary to other nilotic languages leo reinisch 1909 had already proposed linking cushitic and chadic while urging their more distant affinity with egyptian and semitic however his suggestion found little acceptance marcel cohen 1924 rejected the idea of a distinct hamitic subgroup and included hausa a chadic language in his comparative hamitosemitic vocabulary finally joseph greenbergs 1950 work led to the widespread rejection of hamitic as a language category by linguists greenberg refuted meinhofs linguistic theories and rejected the use of racial and social evidence in dismissing the notion of a separate nilohamitic language category in particular greenberg was returning to a view widely held a half century earlier he consequently rejoined meinhofs socalled nilohamitic languages with their appropriate nilotic siblings he also added and subclassified the chadic languages and proposed the new name afroasiatic for the family almost all scholars have accepted this classification as the new and continued consensus greenbergs model was fully developed in his book the languages of africa 1963 in which he reassigned most of meinhofs additions to hamitic to other language families notably nilosaharan following isaac schapera and rejecting meinhof he classified the hottentot language as a member of the central khoisan languages to khoisan he also added the tanzanian hadza and sandawe though this view remains controversial since some scholars consider these languages to be linguistic isolates despite this greenbergs model remains the basis for modern classifications of languages spoken in africa and the hamitic category and its extension to nilohamitic has no part in this since the three traditional branches of the hamitic languages berber cushitic and egyptian have not been shown to form an exclusive monophyletic phylogenetic unit of their own separate from other afroasiatic languages linguists no longer use the term in this sense each of these branches is instead now regarded as an independent subgroup of the larger afroasiatic family in 1969 harold fleming proposed that what had previously been known as western cushitic is an independent branch of afroasiatic suggesting for it the new name omotic this proposal and name have met with widespread acceptance several scholars including harold fleming and robert hetzron have since questioned the traditional inclusion of beja in cushitic glottolog does not accept that the inclusion or even unity of omotic has been established nor that of ongota or the unclassified kujarge it therefore splits off the following groups as small families south omotic

civil war and francoist spain francoist troops reached the andorran border in the later stages of the war during world war ii andorra remained neutral and was an important smuggling route between vichy france and spain given its relative isolation andorra has existed outside the mainstream of european history with few ties to countries other than france spain and portugal in recent times however its thriving tourist industry along with developments in transport and communications have removed the country from its isolation its political system was modernised in 1993 when it became a member of the united nations and the council of europe

32,the embassy of andorra in brussels andorra does not have its own armed forces although there is a small ceremonial army responsibility for defending the nation rests primarily with france and spain however in case of emergencies or natural disasters the sometent an alarm is called and all ablebodied men between 21 and 60 of andorran nationality must serve this is why all andorrans and especially the head of each house usually the eldest ablebodied man of a house should by law keep a rifle even though the law also states that the police will offer a firearm in case of need andorra is a full member of the united nations un the organization for security and cooperation in europe osce and has a special agreement with the european union eu military andorra has a small army which has historically been raised or reconstituted at various dates but has never in modern times amounted to a standing army the basic principle of andorran defence is that all ablebodied men are available to fight if called upon by the sounding of the sometent being a landlocked country andorra has no navy prior to world war i andorra maintained an armed force of about 600 parttime militiamen this body was not liable for service outside the principality and was commanded by two officials viguiers appointed by france and the bishop of urgell despite not being involved in any fighting during the first world war andorra was technically the longest combatant as the country was left out of the versailles peace conference technically remaining at war with germany from its original declaration of war in 1914 until 24 september 1958 when andorra officially declared peace with germany in the modern era the army has consisted of a very small body of volunteers willing to undertake ceremonial duties uniforms were handed down from generation to generation within families and communities the armys role in internal security was largely taken over by the formation of the police corps of andorra in 1931 brief civil disorder associated with the elections of 1933 led to assistance being sought from the french national gendarmerie with a detachment resident in andorra for two months under the command of renéjules baulard the andorran army was reformed in the following year with eleven soldiers appointed to supervisory roles the force consisted of six corporals one for each parish although there are currently seven parishes there were only six until 1978 plus four junior staff officers to coordinate action and a commander with the rank of major it was the responsibility of the six corporals each in his own parish to be able to raise a fighting force from among the ablebodied men of the parish today a small twelveman ceremonial unit remains the only permanent section of the andorran army but all ablebodied men remain technically available for military service with a requirement for each family to have access to a firearm the army has not fought for more than 700 years and its main responsibility is to present the flag of andorra at official ceremonial functions according to marc forné molné andorras military budget is strictly from voluntary donations and the availability of fulltime volunteers the myth that all members of the andorran army are ranked as officers is popularly maintained in many works of reference in reality all those serving in the permanent ceremonial reserve hold ranks as officers or noncommissioned officers because the other ranks are considered to be the rest of the ablebodied male population who may still be called upon by the sometent to serve although such a call has not been made in modern times police corps andorra maintains a small but modern and wellequipped internal police force with around 240 police officers supported by civilian assistants the principal services supplied by the corps are uniformed community policing criminal detection border control and traffic policing there are also small specialist units including police dogs mountain rescue and a bomb disposal team gipa the grup dintervenció policia dandorra gipa is a small special forces unit trained in counterterrorism and hostage recovery tasks although it is the closest in style to an active military force it is part of the police corps and not the army as terrorist and hostage situations are a rare threat to the nation the gipa is commonly assigned to prisoner escort duties and at other times to routine policing fire brigade the andorran fire brigade with headquarters at santa coloma operates from four modern fire stations and has a staff of around 120 firefighters the service is equipped with 16 heavy appliances fire tenders turntable ladders and specialist fourwheel drive vehicles four light support vehicles cars and vans and four ambulances historically the families of the six ancient parishes of andorra maintained local arrangements to assist each other in fighting fires the first fire pump purchased by the government was acquired in 1943 serious fires which lasted for two days in december 1959 led to calls for a permanent fire service and the andorran fire brigade was formed on 21 april 1961 the fire service maintains fulltime cover with five fire crews on duty at any time two at the brigades headquarters in santa coloma and one crew at each of the other three fire stations

33,the arithmetic mean or mean or average is the most commonly used and readily understood measure of central tendency in statistics the term average refers to any of the measures of central tendency the arithmetic mean is defined as being equal to the sum of the numerical values of each and every observation divided by the total number of observations symbolically if we have a data set containing the values then the arithmetic mean is defined by the formula see summation for an explanation of the summation operator for example let us consider the monthly salary of 10 employees of a firm 2500 2700 2400 2300 2550 2650 2750 2450 2600 2400 the arithmetic mean is if the data set is a statistical population ie consists of every possible observation and not just a subset of them then the mean of that population is called the population mean if the data set is a statistical sample a subset of the population we call the statistic resulting from this calculation a sample mean the arithmetic mean of a variable is often denoted by a bar for example as in read bar which is the mean of the values

33,calculations and comparisons between arithmetic and geometric mean of two numbers calculate the arithmetic mean of a series of numbers on fxsolver
33,the arithmetic mean has several properties that make it useful especially as a measure of central tendency these include if numbers have mean then since is the distance from a given number to the mean one way to interpret this property is as saying that the numbers to the left of the mean are balanced by the numbers to the right of the mean the mean is the only single number for which the residuals deviations from the estimate sum to zero if it is required to use a single number as a typical value for a set of known numbers then the arithmetic mean of the numbers does this best in the sense of minimizing the sum of squared deviations from the typical value the sum of it follows that the sample mean is also the best single predictor in the sense of having the lowest root mean squared error if the arithmetic mean of a population of numbers is desired then the estimate of it that is unbiased is the arithmetic mean of a sample drawn from the population
33,particular care must be taken when using cyclic data such as phases or angles naïvely taking the arithmetic mean of 1 and 359 yields a result of 180 this is incorrect for two reasons firstly angle measurements are only defined up to an additive constant of 360 or 2π if measuring in radians thus one could as easily call these 1 and 1 or 361 and 719 each of which gives a different average secondly in this situation 0 equivalently 360 is geometrically a better average value there is lower dispersion about it the points are both 1 from it and 179 from 180 the putative average in general application such an oversight will lead to the average value artificially moving towards the middle of the numerical range a solution to this problem is to use the optimization formulation viz define the mean as the central point the point about which one has the lowest dispersion and redefine the difference as a modular distance ie the distance on the circle so the modular distance between 1 and 359 is 2 not 358
33,in mathematics and statistics the arithmetic mean stress on third syllable of arithmetic or simply the mean or average when the context is clear is the sum of a collection of numbers divided by the number of numbers in the collection the collection is often a set of results of an experiment or a set of results from a survey the term arithmetic mean is preferred in some contexts in mathematics and statistics because it helps distinguish it from other means such as the geometric mean and the harmonic mean in addition to mathematics and statistics the arithmetic mean is used frequently in fields such as economics sociology and history and it is used in almost every academic field to some extent for example per capita income is the arithmetic average income of a nations population while the arithmetic mean is often used to report central tendencies it is not a robust statistic meaning that it is greatly influenced by outliers values that are very much larger or smaller than most of the values notably for skewed distributions such as the distribution of income for which a few peoples incomes are substantially greater than most peoples the arithmetic mean may not accord with ones notion of middle and robust statistics such as the median may be a better description of central tendency

33,weighted average a weighted average or weighted mean is an average in which some data points count more strongly than others in that they are given more weight in the calculation for example the arithmetic mean of and is or equivalently in contrast a weighted mean in which the first number receives for example twice as much weight as the second perhaps because it is assumed to appear twice as often in the general population from which these numbers were sampled would be calculated as here the weights which necessarily sum to the value one are and the former being twice the latter note that the arithmetic mean sometimes called the unweighted average or equally weighted average can be interpreted as a special case of a weighted average in which all the weights are equal to each other equal to in the above example and equal to in a situation with numbers being averaged continuous probability distributions comparison of mean median and mode of two lognormal distributions with different skewness when a population of numbers and any sample of data from it could take on any of a continuous range of numbers instead of for example just integers then the probability of a number falling into one range of possible values could differ from the probability of falling into a different range of possible values even if the lengths of both ranges are the same in such a case the set of probabilities can be described using a continuous probability distribution the analog of a weighted average in this context in which there are an infinitude of possibilities for the precise value of the variable is called the mean of the probability distribution the most widely encountered probability distribution is called the normal distribution it has the property that all measures of its central tendency including not just the mean but also the aforementioned median and the mode are equal to each other this property does not hold however in the cases of a great many probability distributions such as the lognormal distribution illustrated here

33,the arithmetic mean may be contrasted with the median the median is defined such that no more than half the values are larger than and no more than half are smaller than the median if elements in the sample data increase arithmetically when placed in some order then the median and arithmetic average are equal for example consider the data sample the average is as is the median however when we consider a sample that cannot be arranged so as to increase arithmetically such as the median and arithmetic average can differ significantly in this case the arithmetic average is 62 and the median is 4 in general the average value can vary significantly from most values in the sample and can be larger or smaller than most of them there are applications of this phenomenon in many fields for example since the 1980s the median income in the united states has increased more slowly than the arithmetic average of income

35,contemporary reviews of the work were not universally positive writing in the american new republic magazine george soule expressed his disappointment in the book writing that it puzzled and saddened me it seemed on the whole dull the allegory turned out to be a creaking machine for saying in a clumsy way things that have been said better directly soule believed that the animals were not consistent enough with their real world inspirations and said it seems to me that the failure of this book commercially it is already assured of tremendous success arises from the fact that the satire deals not with something the author has experienced but rather with stereotyped ideas about a country which he probably does not know very well the guardian on 24 august 1945 called animal farm a delightfully humorous and caustic satire on the rule of the many by the few tosco fyvel writing in tribune on the same day called the book a gentle satire on a certain state and on the illusions of an age which may already be behind us julian symons responded on 7 september should we not expect in tribune at least acknowledgement of the fact that it is a satire not at all gentle upon a particular statesoviet russia it seems to me that a reviewer should have the courage to identify napoleon with stalin and snowball with trotsky and express an opinion favourable or unfavourable to the author upon a political ground in a hundred years time perhaps animal farm may be simply a fairy story today it is a political satire with a good deal of point animal farm has been subject to much comment in the decades since these early remarks

35,origin george orwell wrote the manuscript in 1943 and 1944 subsequent to his experiences during the spanish civil war which he described in homage to catalonia 1938 in the preface of a 1947 ukrainian edition of animal farm he explained how escaping the communist purges in spain taught him how easily totalitarian propaganda can control the opinion of enlightened people in democratic countries this motivated orwell to expose and strongly condemn what he saw as the stalinist corruption of the original socialist ideals immediately prior to writing the book orwell had quit the bbc he was also upset about a booklet for propagandists the ministry of information had put out the booklet included instructions on how to quell ideological fears of the soviet union such as directions to claim that the red terror was a figment of nazi imagination in the preface orwell also described the source of the idea of setting the book on a farm efforts to find a publisher orwell initially encountered difficulty getting the manuscript published largely due to fears that the book might upset the alliance between britain the united states and the soviet union four publishers refused one had initially accepted the work but declined it after consulting the ministry of information eventually secker and warburg published the first edition in 1945 during the second world war it became clear to orwell that antisoviet literature was not something which most major publishing houses would touchincluding his regular publisher gollancz he also submitted the manuscript to faber and faber where the poet t s eliot who was a director of the firm rejected it eliot wrote back to orwell praising the books good writing and fundamental integrity but declared that they would only accept it for publication if they had some sympathy for the viewpoint which i take to be generally trotskyite eliot said he found the view not convincing and contended that the pigs were made out to be the best to run the farm he posited that someone might argue what was needed was not more communism but more publicspirited pigs orwell let andré deutsch who was working for nicholson watson in 1944 read the typescript and deutsch was convinced that nicholson watson would want to publish it however they did not and lectured orwell on what they perceived to be errors in animal farm in his london letter on 17 april 1944 for partisan review orwell wrote that it was now next door to impossible to get anything overtly antirussian printed antirussian books do appear but mostly from catholic publishing firms and always from a religious or frankly reactionary angle the publisher jonathan cape who had initially accepted animal farm subsequently rejected the book after an official at the british ministry of information warned him offalthough the civil servant who it is assumed gave the order was later found to be a soviet spy writing to leonard moore a partner in the literary agency of christy moore publisher jonathan cape explained that the decision had been taken on the advice of a senior official in the ministry of information such flagrant antisoviet bias was unacceptable and the choice of pigs as the dominant class was thought to be especially offensive it may reasonably be assumed that the important official was a man named peter smollett who was later unmasked as a soviet agent orwell was suspicious of smollettsmolka and he would be one of the names orwell included in his list of cryptocommunists and fellowtravellers sent to the information research department in 1949 born hans peter smolka in vienna in 1912 he came to britain in 1933 as an nkvd agent with the codename abo became a naturalised british subject in 1938 changed his name and after the outbreak of world war ii joined the ministry of information where he organised prosoviet propaganda working with kim philby in 194345 smolletts family have rejected the accusation that he was a spy the publisher wrote to orwell saying frederic warburg also faced pressures against publication even from people in his own office and from his wife pamela who felt that it was not the moment for ingratitude towards stalin and the heroic red army which had played a major part in defeating hitler a russian translation was printed in the paper posev and in giving permission for a russian translation of animal farm orwell refused in advance all royalties a translation in ukrainian which was produced in germany was confiscated in large part by the american wartime authorities and handed over to the soviet repatriation commission in october 1945 orwell wrote to frederic warburg expressing interest in pursuing the possibility that the political cartoonist david low might illustrate animal farm low had written a letter saying that he had had a good time with animal farman excellent bit of satireit would illustrate perfectly nothing came of this and a trial issue produced by secker warburg in 1956 illustrated by john driver was abandoned but the folio society published an edition in 1984 illustrated by quentin blake and an edition illustrated by the cartoonist ralph steadman was published by secker warburg in 1995 to celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of the first edition of animal farm preface orwell originally wrote a preface complaining about british selfcensorship and how the british people were suppressing criticism of the ussr their world war ii ally although the first edition allowed space for the preface it was not included and as of june 2009 most editions of the book have not included it secker and warburg published the first edition of animal farm in 1945 without an introduction however the publisher had provided space for a preface in the authors proof composited from the manuscript for reasons unknown no preface was supplied and the page numbers had to be renumbered at the last minute in 1972 ian angus found the original typescript titled the freedom of the press and bernard crick published it together with his own introduction in the times literary supplement on 15 september 1972 as how the essay came to be written orwells essay criticised british selfcensorship by the press specifically the suppression of unflattering descriptions of stalin and the soviet government the same essay also appeared in the italian 1976 edition of animal farm with another introduction by crick claiming to be the first edition with the preface other publishers were still declining to publish it

manner similar to those who left russia after the fall of the tsar clover a gentle caring female horse who shows concern especially for boxer who often pushes himself too hard clover can read all the letters of the alphabet but cannot put words together she seems to catch on to the sly tricks and schemes set up by napoleon and squealer benjamin a donkey one of the oldest wisest animals on the farm and one of the few who can read properly he is sceptical temperamental and cynical his most frequent remark is life will go on as it has always gone onthat is badly the academic morris dickstein has suggested there is a touch of orwell himself in this creatures timeless skepticism and indeed friends called orwell donkey george after his grumbling donkey benjamin in animal farm other animals

die and faithfully serving whoever happens to be in power napoleon brings the raven back ch ix as stalin brought back the russian orthodox church the sheep they show limited understanding of the animalism and the political atmosphere of the farm yet nonetheless they blindly support napoleons ideals with vocal jingles during his speeches and meetings with snowball some commentators have compared the sheep to representations of state controlled press their constant bleating of four legs good two legs bad was used as a device to drown out any opposition analogous to simplistic headlines used in printed media of the age towards the latter section of the book squealer the propagandist trains the sheep to alter their slogan to four legs good two legs better which they dutifully do symbolizing the state manipulation of media the hens the hens are promised at the start of the revolution that they will get to keep their eggs which are stolen from them under mr jones however their eggs are soon taken from them under the premise of buying goods from outside animal farm the hens are among the first to rebel against napoleon the cows the cows are enticed into the revolution by promises that their milk will not be stolen but can be used to raise their own calves their milk is then stolen by the pigs who learn to milk them the milk is stirred into the pigs mash every day while the other animals are denied such luxuries the cat never seen to carry out any work the cat is absent for long periods and is forgiven because her excuses are so convincing and she purred so affectionately that it was impossible not to believe in her good intentions she has no interest in the politics of the farm and the only time she is recorded as having participated in an election she is found to have actually voted on both sides

35,animalism the pigs snowball napoleon and squealer adapt old majors ideas into a complete system of thought which they formally name animalism an allegoric reference to communism soon after napoleon and squealer partake in activities associated with the humans drinking alcohol sleeping in beds trading which were explicitly prohibited by the seven commandments squealer is employed to alter the seven commandments to account for this humanisation an allusion to the soviet governments revising of history in order to exercise control of the peoples beliefs about themselves and their society squealer sprawls at the foot of the end wall of the big barn where the seven commandments were written ch viii preliminary artwork for a 1950 strip cartoon by norman pett and donald freeman the original commandments are whatever goes upon two legs is an enemy whatever goes upon four legs or has wings is a friend no animal shall wear clothes no animal shall sleep in a bed no animal shall drink alcohol no animal shall kill any other animal all animals are equal these commandments are also distilled into the maxim four legs good two legs bad which is primarily used by the sheep on the farm often to disrupt discussions and disagreements between animals on the nature of animalism later napoleon and his pigs secretly revise some commandments to clear themselves of accusations of lawbreaking the changed commandments are as follows with the changes bolded no animal shall sleep in a bed with sheets no animal shall drink alcohol to excess no animal shall kill any other animal without cause eventually these are replaced with the maxims all animals are equal but some animals are more equal than others and four legs good two legs better as the pigs become more human this is an ironic twist to the original purpose of the seven commandments which were supposed to keep order within animal farm by uniting the animals together against the humans and preventing animals from following the humans evil habits through the revision of the commandments orwell demonstrates how simply political dogma can be turned into malleable propaganda significance and allegory the horn and hoof flag described in the book appears to be based on the hammer and sickle the communist symbol in the eastern bloc both animal farm and later nineteen eightyfour were on the list of forbidden books until the end of communist rule in 1989 and were only available via clandestine samizdat networks orwell biographer jeffrey meyers has written virtually every detail has political significance in this allegory orwell himself wrote in 1946 of course i intended it primarily as a satire on the russian revolutionand that kind of revolution violent conspiratorial revolution led by unconsciously power hungry people can only lead to a change of masters revolutions only effect a radical improvement when the masses are alert in a preface for a 1947 ukrainian edition he stated for the past ten years i have been convinced that the destruction of the soviet myth was essential if we wanted a revival of the socialist movement on my return from spain in 1937 i thought of exposing the soviet myth in a story that could be easily understood by almost anyone and which could be easily translated into other languages the revolt of the animals against farmer jones is orwells analogy with the october 1917 bolshevik revolution the battle of the cowshed has been said to represent the allied invasion of soviet russia in 1918 and the defeat of the white russians in the russian civil war the pigs rise to preeminence mirrors the rise of a stalinist bureaucracy in the ussr just as napoleons emergence as the farms sole leader reflects stalins emergence the pigs appropriation of milk and apples for their own use the turning point of the story as orwell termed it in a letter to dwight macdonald stands as an analogy for the crushing of the leftwing 1921 kronstadt revolt against the bolsheviks and the difficult efforts of the animals to build the windmill suggest the various five year plans the puppies controlled by napoleon parallel the nurture of the secret police in the stalinist structure and the pigs treatment of the other animals on the farm recalls the internal terror faced by the populace in the 1930s in chapter seven when the animals confess their nonexistent crimes and are killed orwell directly alludes to the purges confessions and show trials of the late 1930s these contributed to orwells conviction that the bolshevik revolution had been corrupted and the soviet system become rotten peter edgerly firchow and peter davison consider that the battle of the windmill represents the great patriotic war world war ii especially the battle of stalingrad and the battle of moscow during the battle orwell first wrote all the animals including napoleon took cover orwell had the publisher alter this to all the animals except napoleon in recognition of stalins decision to remain in moscow during the german advance orwell requested the change after he met joseph czapski in paris in march 1945 czapski a survivor of the katyn massacre and an opponent of the soviet regime told orwell as orwell wrote to arthur koestler that it had been the character and greatness of stalin that saved russia from the german invasion rykov skrypnyk and stalin when snowball comes to the crucial points in his speeches he is drowned out by the sheep ch v just as in the party congress in 1927 above at stalins instigation pleas for the opposition were drowned in the continual hysterically intolerant uproar from the floor other connections that writers have suggested illustrate orwells telescoping of russian history from 1917 to 1943 include the wave of rebelliousness that ran through the countryside after the rebellion which stands for the abortive revolutions in hungary and in germany ch iv the conflict between napoleon and snowball ch v paralleling the two rival and quasimessianic beliefs that seemed pitted against one another trotskyism with its faith in the revolutionary vocation of the proletariat of the west and stalinism with its glorification of russias socialist destiny napoleons dealings with whymper and the willingdon markets ch vi paralleling the treaty of rapallo and fredericks forged bank notes paralleling the hitlerstalin nonaggression pact of august 1939 after which frederick attacks animal farm without warning and destroys the windmill the books close with the pigs and men in a kind of rapprochement reflected orwells view of the 1943 teheran conference that seemed to display the establishment of the best possible relations between the ussr and the westbut in reality were destined as orwell presciently predicted to continue to unravel the disagreement between the allies and the start of the cold war is suggested when napoleon and pilkington both suspicious played an ace of spades simultaneously similarly the music in the novel starting with beasts of england and the later anthems parallels the internationale and its adoption and repudiation by the soviet authorities as the anthem of the ussr in the 1920s and 1930s

36,the superclass tetrapoda is divided into four classes of vertebrate animals with four limbs reptiles birds and mammals are amniotes the eggs of which are either laid or carried by the female and are surrounded by several membranes some of which are impervious lacking these membranes amphibians require water bodies for reproduction although some species have developed various strategies for protecting or bypassing the vulnerable aquatic larval stage they are not found in the sea with the exception of one or two frogs that live in brackish water in mangrove swamps on land amphibians are restricted to moist habitats because of the need to keep their skin damp the smallest amphibian and vertebrate in the world is a microhylid frog from new guinea paedophryne amauensis first discovered in 2012 it has an average length of and is part of a genus that contains four of the worlds ten smallest frog species the largest living amphibian is the chinese giant salamander andrias davidianus but this is a great deal smaller than the largest amphibian that ever existedthe extinct prionosuchus a crocodilelike temnospondyl dating to 270 million years ago from the middle permian of brazil the largest frog is the african goliath frog conraua goliath which can reach and weigh amphibians are ectothermic coldblooded vertebrates that do not maintain their body temperature through internal physiological processes their metabolic rate is low and as a result their food and energy requirements are limited in the adult state they have tear ducts and movable eyelids and most species have ears that can detect airborne or ground vibrations they have muscular tongues which in many species can be protruded modern amphibians have fully ossified vertebrae with articular processes their ribs are usually short and may be fused to the vertebrae their skulls are mostly broad and short and are often incompletely ossified their skin contains little keratin and lacks scales apart from a few fishlike scales in certain caecilians the skin contains many mucous glands and in some species poison glands a type of granular gland the hearts of amphibians have three chambers two atria and one ventricle they have a urinary bladder and nitrogenous waste products are excreted primarily as urea most amphibians lay their eggs in water and have aquatic larvae that undergo metamorphosis to become terrestrial adults amphibians breathe by means of a pump action in which air is first drawn into the buccopharyngeal region through the nostrils these are then closed and the air is forced into the lungs by contraction of the throat they supplement this with gas exchange through the skin anura redeyed tree frog agalychnis callidryas with limbs and feet specialised for climbing the order anura from the ancient greek an meaning without and oura meaning tail comprises the frogs and toads they usually have long hind limbs that fold underneath them shorter forelimbs webbed toes with no claws no tails large eyes and glandular moist skin members of this order with smooth skins are commonly referred to as frogs while those with warty skins are known as toads the difference is not a formal one taxonomically and there are numerous exceptions to this rule members of the family bufonidae are known as the true toads frogs range in size from the goliath frog conraua goliath of west africa to the paedophryne amauensis first described in papua new guinea in 2012 which is also the smallest known vertebrate although most species are associated with water and damp habitats some are specialised to live in trees or in deserts they are found worldwide except for polar areas anura is divided into three suborders that are broadly accepted by the scientific community but the relationships between some families remain unclear future molecular studies should provide further insights into their evolutionary relationships the suborder archaeobatrachia contains four families of primitive frogs these are ascaphidae bombinatoridae discoglossidae and leiopelmatidae which have few derived features and are probably paraphyletic with regard to other frog lineages the six families in the more evolutionarily advanced suborder mesobatrachia are the fossorial megophryidae pelobatidae pelodytidae scaphiopodidae and rhinophrynidae and the obligatorily aquatic pipidae these have certain characteristics that are intermediate between the two other suborders neobatrachia is by far the largest suborder and includes the remaining families of modern frogs including most common species ninetysix percent of the over 5000 extant species of frog are neobatrachians caudata japanese giant salamander andrias japonicus a primitive salamander the order caudata from the latin cauda meaning tail consists of the salamanderselongated lowslung animals that mostly resemble lizards in form this is a symplesiomorphic trait and they are no more closely related to lizards than they are to mammals salamanders lack claws have scalefree skins either smooth or covered with tubercles and tails that are usually flattened from side to side and often finned they range in size from the chinese giant salamander andrias davidianus which has been reported to grow to a length of to the diminutive thorius pennatulus from mexico which seldom exceeds in length salamanders have a mostly laurasian distribution being present in much of the holarctic region of the northern hemisphere the family plethodontidae is also found in central america and south america north of the amazon basin south america was apparently invaded from central america by about the start of the miocene 23 million years ago urodela is a name sometimes used for all the extant species of salamanders members of several salamander families have become paedomorphic and either fail to complete their metamorphosis or retain some larval characteristics as adults most salamanders are under long they may be terrestrial or aquatic and many spend part of the year in each habitat when on land they mostly spend the day hidden under stones or logs or in dense vegetation emerging in the evening and night to forage for worms insects and other invertebrates danube crested newt triturus dobrogicus an advanced salamander the suborder cryptobranchoidea contains the primitive salamanders a number of fossil cryptobranchids have been found but there are only three living species the chinese giant salamander andrias davidianus the japanese giant salamander andrias japonicus and the hellbender cryptobranchus alleganiensis from north america these large amphibians retain several larval characteristics in their adult state gills slits are present and the eyes are unlidded a unique feature is their ability to feed by suction depressing either the left side of their lower jaw or the right the males excavate nests persuade females to lay their egg strings inside them and guard them as well as breathing with lungs they respire through the many folds in their thin skin which has capillaries close to the surface the suborder salamandroidea contains the advanced salamanders they differ from the cryptobranchids by having fused prearticular bones in the lower jaw and by using internal fertilisation in salamandrids the male deposits a bundle of sperm the spermatophore and the female picks it up and inserts it into her cloaca where the sperm is stored until the eggs are laid the largest family in this group is plethodontidae the lungless salamanders which includes 60 of all salamander species the family salamandridae includes the true salamanders and the name newt is given to members of its subfamily pleurodelinae the third suborder sirenoidea contains the four species of sirens which are in a single family sirenidae members of this order are eellike aquatic salamanders with much reduced forelimbs and no hind limbs some of their features are primitive while others are derived fertilisation is likely to be external as sirenids lack the cloacal glands used by male salamandrids to produce spermatophores and the females lack spermathecae for sperm storage despite this the eggs are laid singly a behaviour not conducive for external fertilisation gymnophiona the limbless south american caecilian siphonops paulensis the order gymnophiona from the greek gymnos meaning naked and ophis meaning serpent or apoda from the latin an meaning without and the greek poda meaning legs comprises the caecilians these are long cylindrical limbless animals with a snake or wormlike form the adults vary in length from 8 to 75 centimetres 3 to 30 inches with the exception of thomsons caecilian caecilia thompsoni which can reach a caecilians skin has a large number of transverse folds and in some species contains tiny embedded dermal scales it has rudimentary eyes covered in skin which are probably limited to discerning differences in light intensity it also has a pair of short tentacles near the eye that can be extended and which have tactile and olfactory functions most caecilians live underground in burrows in damp soil in rotten wood and under plant debris but some are aquatic most species lay their eggs underground and when the larvae hatch they make their way to adjacent bodies of water others brood their eggs and the larvae undergo metamorphosis before the eggs hatch a few species give birth to live young nourishing them with glandular secretions while they are in the oviduct caecilians have a mostly gondwanan distribution being found in tropical regions of africa asia and central and south america

36,the extinct golden toad bufo periglenes last seen in 1989 dramatic declines in amphibian populations including population crashes and mass localized extinction have been noted since the late 1980s from locations all over the world and amphibian declines are thus perceived to be one of the most critical threats to global biodiversity in 2004 the international union for conservation of nature iucn reported stating that currently birds mammals and amphibians extinction rates were at minimum 48 times greater than natural extinction ratespossibly 1024 times higher in 2006 there were believed to be 4035 species of amphibians that depended on water at some stage during their life cycle of these 1356 336 were considered to be threatened and this figure is likely to be an underestimate because it excludes 1427 species for which there was insufficient data to assess their status a number of causes are believed to be involved including habitat destruction and modification overexploitation pollution introduced species climate change endocrinedisrupting pollutants destruction of the ozone layer ultraviolet radiation has shown to be especially damaging to the skin eyes and eggs of amphibians and diseases like chytridiomycosis however many of the causes of amphibian declines are still poorly understood and are a topic of ongoing discussion the hula painted frog discoglossus nigriventer was believed to be extinct but was rediscovered in 2011 with their complex reproductive needs and permeable skins amphibians are often considered to be ecological indicators in many terrestrial ecosystems they constitute one of the largest parts of the vertebrate biomass any decline in amphibian numbers will affect the patterns of predation the loss of carnivorous species near the top of the food chain will upset the delicate ecosystem balance and may cause dramatic increases in opportunistic species in the middle east a growing appetite for eating frog legs and the consequent gathering of them for food was linked to an increase in mosquitoes predators that feed on amphibians are affected by their decline the western terrestrial garter snake thamnophis elegans in california is largely aquatic and depends heavily on two species of frog that are decreasing in numbers the yosemite toad bufo canorus and the mountain yellowlegged frog rana muscosa putting the snakes future at risk if the snake were to become scarce this would affect birds of prey and other predators that feed on it meanwhile in the ponds and lakes fewer frogs means fewer tadpoles these normally play an important role in controlling the growth of algae and also forage on detritus that accumulates as sediment on the bottom a reduction in the number of tadpoles may lead to an overgrowth of algae resulting in depletion of oxygen in the water when the algae later die and decompose aquatic invertebrates and fish might then die and there would be unpredictable ecological consequences a global strategy to stem the crisis was released in 2005 in the form of the amphibian conservation action plan developed by over eighty leading experts in the field this call to action details what would be required to curtail amphibian declines and extinctions over the following five years and how much this would cost the amphibian specialist group of the iucn is spearheading efforts to implement a comprehensive global strategy for amphibian conservation amphibian ark is an organization that was formed to implement the exsitu conservation recommendations of this plan and they have been working with zoos and aquaria around the world encouraging them to create assurance colonies of threatened amphibians one such project is the panama amphibian rescue and conservation project that built on existing conservation efforts in panama to create a countrywide response to the threat of chytridiomycosis

36,most amphibians go through metamorphosis a process of significant morphological change after birth in typical amphibian development eggs are laid in water and larvae are adapted to an aquatic lifestyle frogs toads and salamanders all hatch from the egg as larvae with external gills metamorphosis in amphibians is regulated by thyroxine concentration in the blood which stimulates metamorphosis and prolactin which counteracts thyroxines effect specific events are dependent on threshold values for different tissues because most embryonic development is outside the parental body it is subject to many adaptations due to specific environmental circumstances for this reason tadpoles can have horny ridges instead of teeth whiskerlike skin extensions or fins they also make use of a sensory lateral line organ similar to that of fish after metamorphosis these organs become redundant and will be reabsorbed by controlled cell death called apoptosis the variety of adaptations to specific environmental circumstances among amphibians is wide with many discoveries still being made eggs frogspawn a mass of eggs surrounded by jelly amphibian egg 1 jelly capsule 2 vitelline membrane 3 perivitelline fluid 4 yolk plug 5 embryo the egg of an amphibian is typically surrounded by a transparent gelatinous covering secreted by the oviducts and containing mucoproteins and mucopolysaccharides this capsule is permeable to water and gases and swells considerably as it absorbs water the ovum is at first rigidly held but in fertilised eggs the innermost layer liquefies and allows the embryo to move freely this also happens in salamander eggs even when they are unfertilised eggs of some salamanders and frogs contain unicellular green algae these penetrate the jelly envelope after the eggs are laid and may increase the supply of oxygen to the embryo through photosynthesis they seem to both speed up the development of the larvae and reduce mortality most eggs contain the pigment melanin which raises their temperature through the absorption of light and also protects them against ultraviolet radiation caecilians some plethodontid salamanders and certain frogs lay eggs underground that are unpigmented in the wood frog rana sylvatica the interior of the globular egg cluster has been found to be up to warmer than its surroundings which is an advantage in its cool northern habitat the eggs may be deposited singly or in small groups or may take the form of spherical egg masses rafts or long strings in terrestrial caecilians the eggs are laid in grapelike clusters in burrows near streams the amphibious salamander ensatina attaches its similar clusters by stalks to underwater stems and roots the greenhouse frog eleutherodactylus planirostris lays eggs in small groups in the soil where they develop in about two weeks directly into juvenile frogs without an intervening larval stage the tungara frog physalaemus pustulosus builds a floating nest from foam to protect its eggs first a raft is built then eggs are laid in the centre and finally a foam cap is overlaid the foam has antimicrobial properties it contains no detergents but is created by whipping up proteins and lectins secreted by the female larvae early stages in the development of the embryos of the common frog rana temporaria the eggs of amphibians are typically laid in water and hatch into freeliving larvae that complete their development in water and later transform into either aquatic or terrestrial adults in many species of frog and in most lungless salamanders plethodontidae direct development takes place the larvae growing within the eggs and emerging as miniature adults many caecilians and some other amphibians lay their eggs on land and the newly hatched larvae wriggle or are transported to water bodies some caecilians the alpine salamander salamandra atra and some of the african livebearing toads nectophrynoides spp are viviparous their larvae feed on glandular secretions and develop within the females oviduct often for long periods other amphibians but not caecilians are ovoviviparous the eggs are retained in or on the parents body but the larvae subsist on the yolks of their eggs and receive no nourishment from the adult the larvae emerge at varying stages of their growth either before or after metamorphosis according to their species the toad genus nectophrynoides exhibits all of these developmental patterns among its dozen or so members frogs frog larvae are known as tadpoles and typically have oval bodies and long vertically flattened tails with fins the freeliving larvae are normally fully aquatic but the tadpoles of some species such as nannophrys ceylonensis are semiterrestrial and live among wet rocks tadpoles have cartilaginous skeletons gills for respiration external gills at first internal gills later lateral line systems and large tails that they use for swimming newly hatched tadpoles soon develop gill pouches that cover the gills the lungs develop early and are used as accessory breathing organs the tadpoles rising to the water surface to gulp air some species complete their development inside the egg and hatch directly into small frogs these larvae do not have gills but instead have specialised areas of skin through which respiration takes place while tadpoles do not have true teeth in most species the jaws have long parallel rows of small keratinized structures called keradonts surrounded by a horny beak front legs are formed under the gill sac and hind legs become visible a few days later amphibian metamorphosis iodine and t4 over stimulate the spectacular apoptosis programmed cell death of the cells of the larval gills tail and fins also stimulate the evolution of nervous systems transforming the aquatic vegetarian tadpole into the terrestrial carnivorous frog with better neurological visuospatial olfactory and cognitive abilities for hunting in fact tadpoles developing in ponds and streams are typically herbivorous pond tadpoles tend to have deep bodies large caudal fins and small mouths they swim in the quiet waters feeding on growing or loose fragments of vegetation stream dwellers mostly have larger mouths shallow bodies and caudal fins they attach themselves to plants and stones and feed on the surface films of algae and bacteria they also feed on diatoms filtered from the water through the gills and stir up the sediment at bottom of the pond ingesting edible fragments they have a relatively long spiralshaped gut to enable them to digest this diet some species are carnivorous at the tadpole stage eating insects smaller tadpoles and fish young of the cuban tree frog osteopilus septentrionalis can occasionally be cannibalistic the younger tadpoles attacking a larger more developed tadpole when it is undergoing metamorphosis at metamorphosis rapid changes in the body take place as the lifestyle of the frog changes completely the spiralshaped mouth with horny tooth ridges is reabsorbed together with the spiral gut the animal develops a large jaw and its gills disappear along with its gill sac eyes and legs grow quickly and a tongue is formed there are associated changes in the neural networks such as development of stereoscopic vision and loss of the lateral line system all this can happen in about a day a few days later the tail is reabsorbed due to the higher thyroxine concentration required for this to take place salamanders larva of the longtoed salamander ambystoma macrodactylum larvae of the alpine newt ichthyosaura alpestris at hatching a typical salamander larva has eyes without lids teeth in both upper and lower jaws three pairs of feathery external gills a somewhat laterally flattened body and a long tail with dorsal and ventral fins the forelimbs may be partially developed and the hind limbs are rudimentary in pondliving species but may be rather more developed in species that reproduce in moving water pondtype larvae often have a pair of balancers rodlike structures on either side of the head that may prevent the gills from becoming clogged up with sediment some members of the genera ambystoma and dicamptodon have larvae that never fully develop into the adult form but this varies with species and with populations the northwestern salamander ambystoma gracile is one of these and depending on environmental factors either remains permanently in the larval state a condition known as neoteny or transforms into an adult both of these are able to breed neoteny occurs when the animals growth rate is very low and is usually linked to adverse conditions such as low water temperatures that may change the response of the tissues to the hormone thyroxine other factors that may inhibit metamorphosis include lack of food lack of trace elements and competition from conspecifics the tiger salamander ambystoma tigrinum also sometimes behaves in this way and may grow particularly large in the process the adult tiger salamander is terrestrial but the larva is aquatic and able to breed while still in the larval state when conditions are particularly inhospitable on land larval breeding may allow continuation of a population that would otherwise die out there are fifteen species of obligate neotenic salamanders including species of necturus proteus and amphiuma and many examples of facultative ones that adopt this strategy under appropriate environmental circumstances lungless salamanders in the family plethodontidae are terrestrial and lay a small number of unpigmented eggs in a cluster among damp leaf litter each egg has a large yolk sac and the larva feeds on this while it develops inside the egg emerging fully formed as a juvenile salamander the female salamander often broods the eggs in the genus ensatinas the female has been observed to coil around them and press her throat area against them effectively massaging them with a mucous secretion in newts and salamanders metamorphosis is less dramatic than in frogs this is because the larvae are already carnivorous and continue to feed as predators when they are adults so few changes are needed to their digestive systems their lungs are functional early but the larvae do not make as much use of them as do tadpoles their gills are never covered by gill sacs and are reabsorbed just before the animals leave the water other changes include the reduction in size or loss of tail fins the closure of gill slits thickening of the skin the development of eyelids and certain changes in dentition and tongue structure salamanders are at their most vulnerable at metamorphosis as swimming speeds are reduced and transforming tails are encumbrances on land adult salamanders often have an aquatic phase in spring and summer and a land phase in winter for adaptation to a water phase prolactin is the required hormone and for adaptation to the land phase thyroxine external gills do not return in subsequent aquatic phases because these are completely absorbed upon leaving the water for the first time caecilians the caecilian ichthyophis glutinosus with eggs and developing embryo most terrestrial caecilians that lay eggs do so in burrows or moist places on land near bodies of water the development of the young of ichthyophis glutinosus a species from sri lanka has been much studied the eellike larvae hatch out of the eggs and make their way to water they have three pairs of external red feathery gills a blunt head with two rudimentary eyes a lateral line system and a short tail with fins they swim by undulating their body from side to side they are mostly active at night soon lose their gills and make sorties onto land metamorphosis is gradual by the age of about ten months they have developed a pointed head with sensory tentacles near the mouth and lost their eyes lateral line systems and tails the skin thickens embedded scales develop and the body divides into segments by this time the caecilian has constructed a burrow and is living on land ringed caecilian siphonops annulatus resembles an earthworm in the majority of species of caecilians the young are produced by vivipary typhlonectes compressicauda a species from south america is typical of these up to nine larvae can develop in the oviduct at any one time they are elongated and have paired saclike gills small eyes and specialised scraping teeth at first they feed on the yolks of the eggs but as this source of nourishment declines they begin to rasp at the ciliated epithelial cells that line the oviduct this stimulates the secretion of fluids rich in lipids and mucoproteins on which they feed along with scrapings from the oviduct wall they may increase their length sixfold and be twofifths as long as their mother before being born by this time they have undergone metamorphosis lost their eyes and gills developed a thicker skin and mouth tentacles and reabsorbed their teeth a permanent set of teeth grow through soon after birth the ringed caecilian siphonops annulatus has developed a unique adaptation for the purposes of reproduction the progeny feed on a skin layer that is specially developed by the adult in a phenomenon known as maternal dermatophagy the brood feed as a batch for about seven minutes at intervals of approximately three days which gives the skin an opportunity to regenerate meanwhile they have been observed to ingest fluid exuded from the maternal cloaca parental care male common rocket frog colostethus panamensis carrying tadpoles on his back the care of offspring among amphibians has been little studied but in general the larger the number of eggs in a batch the less likely it is that any degree of parental care takes place nevertheless it is estimated that in up to 20 of amphibian species one or both adults play some role in the care of the young those species that breed in smaller water bodies or other specialised habitats tend to have complex patterns of behaviour in the care of their young many woodland salamanders lay clutches of eggs under dead logs or stones on land the black mountain salamander desmognathus welteri does this the mother brooding the eggs and guarding them from predation as the embryos feed on the yolks of their eggs when fully developed they break their way out of the egg capsules and disperse as juvenile salamanders the male hellbender a primitive salamander excavates an underwater nest and encourages females to lay there the male then guards the site for the two or three months before the eggs hatch using body undulations to fan the eggs and increase their supply of oxygen male common midwife toad alytes obstetricans carrying eggs the male colostethus subpunctatus a tiny frog protects the egg cluster which is hidden under a stone or log when the eggs hatch the male transports the tadpoles on his back stuck there by a mucous secretion to a temporary pool where he dips himself into the water and the tadpoles drop off the male midwife toad alytes obstetricans winds egg strings round his thighs and carries the eggs around for up to eight weeks he keeps them moist and when they are ready to hatch he visits a pond or ditch and releases the tadpoles the female gastricbrooding frog rheobatrachus spp reared larvae in her stomach after swallowing either the eggs or hatchlings however this stage was never observed before the species became extinct the tadpoles secrete a hormone that inhibits digestion in the mother whilst they develop by consuming their very large yolk supply the pouched frog assa darlingtoni lays eggs on the ground when they hatch the male carries the tadpoles around in brood pouches on his hind legs the aquatic surinam toad pipa pipa raises its young in pores on its back where they remain until metamorphosis the granular poison frog oophaga granulifera is typical of a number of tree frogs in the poison dart frog family dendrobatidae its eggs are laid on the forest floor and when they hatch the tadpoles are carried one by one on the back of an adult to a suitable waterfilled crevice such as the axil of a leaf or the rosette of a bromeliad the female visits the nursery sites regularly and deposits unfertilised eggs in the water and these are consumed by the tadpoles
36,the worlds smallest known vertebrate paedophryne amauensis sitting on a us dime which is 179 mm in diameter for scale the word amphibian is derived from the ancient greek term ἀμφίβιος amphíbios which means both kinds of life ἀμφί meaning of both kinds and βιος meaning life the term was initially used as a general adjective for animals that could live on land or in water including seals and otters traditionally the class amphibia includes all tetrapod vertebrates that are not amniotes amphibia in its widest sense sensu lato was divided into three subclasses two of which are extinct subclass lepospondyli small paleozoic group which may actually be more closely related to amniotes than lissamphibia subclass temnospondyli diverse paleozoic and early mesozoic grade subclass lissamphibia all modern amphibians including frogs toads salamanders newts and caecilians salientia frogs toads and relatives jurassic to present6200 current species in 53 families caudata salamanders newts and relatives jurassic to present652 current species in 9 families gymnophiona caecilians and relatives jurassic to present192 current species in 10 families triadobatrachus massinoti a protofrog from the early triassic of madagascar the actual number of species in each group depends on the taxonomic classification followed the two most common systems are the classification adopted by the website amphibiaweb university of california berkeley and the classification by herpetologist darrel frost and the american museum of natural history available as the online reference database amphibian species of the world the numbers of species cited above follows frost and the total number of known amphibian species is over 7000 of which nearly 90 are frogs with the phylogenetic classification the taxon labyrinthodontia has been discarded as it is a polyparaphyletic group without unique defining features apart from shared primitive characteristics classification varies according to the preferred phylogeny of the author and whether they use a stembased or a nodebased classification traditionally amphibians as a class are defined as all tetrapods with a larval stage while the group that includes the common ancestors of all living amphibians frogs salamanders and caecilians and all their descendants is called lissamphibia the phylogeny of paleozoic amphibians is uncertain and lissamphibia may possibly fall within extinct groups like the temnospondyli traditionally placed in the subclass labyrinthodontia or the lepospondyli and in some analyses even in the amniotes this means that advocates of phylogenetic nomenclature have removed a large number of basal devonian and carboniferous amphibiantype tetrapod groups that were formerly placed in amphibia in linnaean taxonomy and included them elsewhere under cladistic taxonomy if the common ancestor of amphibians and amniotes is included in amphibia it becomes a paraphyletic group all modern amphibians are included in the subclass lissamphibia which is usually considered a clade a group of species that have evolved from a common ancestor the three modern orders are anura the frogs and toads caudata or urodela the salamanders and gymnophiona or apoda the caecilians it has been suggested that salamanders arose separately from a temnospondyllike ancestor and even that caecilians are the sister group of the advanced reptiliomorph amphibians and thus of amniotes although the fossils of several older protofrogs with primitive characteristics are known the oldest true frog is prosalirus bitis from the early jurassic kayenta formation of arizona it is anatomically very similar to modern frogs the oldest known caecilian is another early jurassic species eocaecilia micropodia also from arizona the earliest salamander is beiyanerpeton jianpingensis from the late jurassic of northeastern china authorities disagree as to whether salientia is a superorder that includes the order anura or whether anura is a suborder of the order salientia the lissamphibia are traditionally divided into three orders but an extinct salamanderlike family the albanerpetontidae is now considered part of lissamphibia alongside the superorder salientia furthermore salientia includes all three recent orders plus the triassic protofrog triadobatrachus

36,skin bright colours of the common reed frog hyperolius viridiflavus are typical of a toxic species the integumentary structure contains some typical characteristics common to terrestrial vertebrates such as the presence of highly cornified outer layers renewed periodically through a moulting process controlled by the pituitary and thyroid glands local thickenings often called warts are common such as those found on toads the outside of the skin is shed periodically mostly in one piece in contrast to mammals and birds where it is shed in flakes amphibians often eat the sloughed skin caecilians are unique among amphibians in having mineralized dermal scales embedded in the dermis between the furrows in the skin the similarity of these to the scales of bony fish is largely superficial lizards and some frogs have somewhat similar osteoderms forming bony deposits in the dermis but this is an example of convergent evolution with similar structures having arisen independently in diverse vertebrate lineages cross section of frog skin a mucus gland b chromatophore c granular poison gland d connective tissue e stratum corneum f transition zone g epidermis h dermis amphibian skin is permeable to water gas exchange can take place through the skin cutaneous respiration and this allows adult amphibians to respire without rising to the surface of water and to hibernate at the bottom of ponds to compensate for their thin and delicate skin amphibians have evolved mucous glands principally on their heads backs and tails the secretions produced by these help keep the skin moist in addition most species of amphibian have granular glands that secrete distasteful or poisonous substances some amphibian toxins can be lethal to humans while others have little effect the main poisonproducing glands the paratoids produce the neurotoxin bufotoxin and are located behind the ears of toads along the backs of frogs behind the eyes of salamanders and on the upper surface of caecilians the skin colour of amphibians is produced by three layers of pigment cells called chromatophores these three cell layers consist of the melanophores occupying the deepest layer the guanophores forming an intermediate layer and containing many granules producing a bluegreen colour and the lipophores yellow the most superficial layer the colour change displayed by many species is initiated by hormones secreted by the pituitary gland unlike bony fish there is no direct control of the pigment cells by the nervous system and this results in the colour change taking place more slowly than happens in fish a vividly coloured skin usually indicates that the species is toxic and is a warning sign to predators skeletal system and locomotion amphibians have a skeletal system that is structurally homologous to other tetrapods though with a number of variations they all have four limbs except for the legless caecilians and a few species of salamander with reduced or no limbs the bones are hollow and lightweight the musculoskeletal system is strong to enable it to support the head and body the bones are fully ossified and the vertebrae interlock with each other by means of overlapping processes the pectoral girdle is supported by muscle and the welldeveloped pelvic girdle is attached to the backbone by a pair of sacral ribs the ilium slopes forward and the body is held closer to the ground than is the case in mammals skeleton of the surinam horned frogceratophrys cornuta in most amphibians there are four digits on the fore foot and five on the hind foot but no claws on either some salamanders have fewer digits and the amphiumas are eellike in appearance with tiny stubby legs the sirens are aquatic salamanders with stumpy forelimbs and no hind limbs the caecilians are limbless they burrow in the manner of earthworms with zones of muscle contractions moving along the body on the surface of the ground or in water they move by undulating their body from side to side in frogs the hind legs are larger than the fore legs especially so in those species that principally move by jumping or swimming in the walkers and runners the hind limbs are not so large and the burrowers mostly have short limbs and broad bodies the feet have adaptations for the way of life with webbing between the toes for swimming broad adhesive toe pads for climbing and keratinised tubercles on the hind feet for digging frogs usually dig backwards into the soil in most salamanders the limbs are short and more or less the same length and project at right angles from the body locomotion on land is by walking and the tail often swings from side to side or is used as a prop particularly when climbing in their normal gait only one leg is advanced at a time in the manner adopted by their ancestors the lobefinned fish some salamanders in the genus aneides and certain plethodontids climb trees and have long limbs large toepads and prehensile tails in aquatic salamanders and in frog tadpoles the tail has dorsal and ventral fins and is moved from side to side as a means of propulsion adult frogs do not have tails and caecilians have only very short ones salamanders use their tails in defence and some are prepared to jettison them to save their lives in a process known as autotomy certain species in the plethodontidae have a weak zone at the base of the tail and use this strategy readily the tail often continues to twitch after separation which may distract the attacker and allow the salamander to escape both tails and limbs can be regenerated adult frogs are unable to regrow limbs but tadpoles can do so circulatory system didactic model of an amphibian heart juvenile amphibian circulatory systems are single loop systems which resemble fish 1 internal gills where the blood is reoxygenated2 point where the blood is depleted of oxygen and returns to the heart via veins3 two chambered heartred indicates oxygenated blood and blue represents oxygen depleted blood amphibians have a juvenile stage and an adult stage and the circulatory systems of the two are distinct in the juvenile or tadpole stage the circulation is similar to that of a fish the twochambered heart pumps the blood through the gills where it is oxygenated and is spread around the body and back to the heart in a single loop in the adult stage amphibians especially frogs lose their gills and develop lungs they have a heart that consists of a single ventricle and two atria when the ventricle starts contracting deoxygenated blood is pumped through the pulmonary artery to the lungs continued contraction then pumps oxygenated blood around the rest of the body mixing of the two bloodstreams is minimized by the anatomy of the chambers nervous and sensory systems the nervous system is basically the same as in other vertebrates with a central brain a spinal cord and nerves throughout the body the amphibian brain is less well developed than that of reptiles birds and mammals but is similar in morphology and function to that of a fish it is believed amphibians are capable of perceiving pain the brain consists of equal parts cerebrum midbrain and cerebellum various parts of the cerebrum process sensory input such as smell in the olfactory lobe and sight in the optic lobe and it is additionally the centre of behaviour and learning the cerebellum is the center of muscular coordination and the medulla oblongata controls some organ functions including heartbeat and respiration the brain sends signals through the spinal cord and nerves to regulate activity in the rest of the body the pineal body known to regulate sleep patterns in humans is thought to produce the hormones involved in hibernation and aestivation in amphibians tadpoles retain the lateral line system of their ancestral fishes but this is lost in terrestrial adult amphibians some caecilians possess electroreceptors that allow them to locate objects around them when submerged in water the ears are well developed in frogs there is no external ear but the large circular eardrum lies on the surface of the head just behind the eye this vibrates and sound is transmitted through a single bone the stapes to the inner ear only highfrequency sounds like mating calls are heard in this way but lowfrequency noises can be detected through another mechanism there is a patch of specialized haircells called papilla amphibiorum in the inner ear capable of detecting deeper sounds another feature unique to frogs and salamanders is the columellaoperculum complex adjoining the auditory capsule which is involved in the transmission of both airborne and seismic signals the ears of salamanders and caecilians are less highly developed than those of frogs as they do not normally communicate with each other through the medium of sound the eyes of tadpoles lack lids but at metamorphosis the cornea becomes more domeshaped the lens becomes flatter and eyelids and associated glands and ducts develop the adult eyes are an improvement on invertebrate eyes and were a first step in the development of more advanced vertebrate eyes they allow colour vision and depth of focus in the retinas are green rods which are receptive to a wide range of wavelengths digestive and excretory systems dissected frog 1 right atrium 2 liver 3 aorta 4 egg mass 5 colon 6 left atrium 7 ventricle 8 stomach 9 left lung 10 gallbladder 11 small intestine 12 cloaca many amphibians catch their prey by flicking out an elongated tongue with a sticky tip and drawing it back into the mouth before seizing the item with their jaws some use inertial feeding to help them swallow the prey repeatedly thrusting their head forward sharply causing the food to move backwards in their mouth by inertia most amphibians swallow their prey whole without much chewing so they possess voluminous stomachs the short oesophagus is lined with cilia that help to move the food to the stomach and mucus produced by glands in the mouth and pharynx eases its passage the enzyme chitinase produced in the stomach helps digest the chitinous cuticle of arthropod prey amphibians possess a pancreas liver and gall bladder the liver is usually large with two lobes its size is determined by its function as a glycogen and fat storage unit and may change with the seasons as these reserves are built or used up adipose tissue is another important means of storing energy and this occurs in the abdomen in internal structures called fat bodies under the skin and in some salamanders in the tail there are two kidneys located dorsally near the roof of the body cavity their job is to filter the blood of metabolic waste and transport the urine via ureters to the urinary bladder where it is stored before being passed out periodically through the cloacal vent larvae and most aquatic adult amphibians excrete the nitrogen as ammonia in large quantities of dilute urine while terrestrial species with a greater need to conserve water excrete the less toxic product urea some tree frogs with limited access to water excrete most of their metabolic waste as uric acid respiratory system the axolotl ambystoma mexicanum retains its larval form with gills into adulthood the lungs in amphibians are primitive compared to those of amniotes possessing few internal septa and large alveoli and consequently having a comparatively slow diffusion rate for oxygen entering the blood ventilation is accomplished by buccal pumping most amphibians however are able to exchange gases with the water or air via their skin to enable sufficient cutaneous respiration the surface of their highly vascularised skin must remain moist to allow the oxygen to diffuse at a sufficiently high rate because oxygen concentration in the water increases at both low temperatures and high flow rates aquatic amphibians in these situations can rely primarily on cutaneous respiration as in the titicaca water frog and the hellbender salamander in air where oxygen is more concentrated some small species can rely solely on cutaneous gas exchange most famously the plethodontid salamanders which have neither lungs nor gills many aquatic salamanders and all tadpoles have gills in their larval stage with some such as the axolotl retaining gills as aquatic adults
36,northwestern salamander ambystoma gracile eating a worm with a few exceptions adult amphibians are predators feeding on virtually anything that moves that they can swallow the diet mostly consists of small prey that do not move too fast such as beetles caterpillars earthworms and spiders the sirens siren spp often ingest aquatic plant material with the invertebrates on which they feed and a brazilian tree frog xenohyla truncata includes a large quantity of fruit in its diet the mexican burrowing toad rhinophrynus dorsalis has a specially adapted tongue for picking up ants and termites it projects it with the tip foremost whereas other frogs flick out the rear part first their tongues being hinged at the front food is mostly selected by sight even in conditions of dim light movement of the prey triggers a feeding response frogs have been caught on fish hooks baited with red flannel and green frogs rana clamitans have been found with stomachs full of elm seeds that they had seen floating past toads salamanders and caecilians also use smell to detect prey this response is mostly secondary because salamanders have been observed to remain stationary near odoriferous prey but only feed if it moves cavedwelling amphibians normally hunt by smell some salamanders seem to have learned to recognize immobile prey when it has no smell even in complete darkness amphibians usually swallow food whole but may chew it lightly first to subdue it they typically have small hinged pedicellate teeth a feature unique to amphibians the base and crown of these are composed of dentine separated by an uncalcified layer and they are replaced at intervals salamanders caecilians and some frogs have one or two rows of teeth in both jaws but some frogs rana spp lack teeth in the lower jaw and toads bufo spp have no teeth in many amphibians there are also vomerine teeth attached to a facial bone in the roof of the mouth edible frog pelophylax esculentus exhibiting cannibalism the tiger salamander ambystoma tigrinum is typical of the frogs and salamanders that hide under cover ready to ambush unwary invertebrates others amphibians such as the bufo spp toads actively search for prey while the argentine horned frog ceratophrys ornata lures inquisitive prey closer by raising its hind feet over its back and vibrating its yellow toes among leaf litter frogs in panama frogs that actively hunt prey have narrow mouths and are slim often brightly coloured and toxic while ambushers have wide mouths and are broad and wellcamouflaged caecilians do not flick their tongues but catch their prey by grabbing it with their slightly backwardpointing teeth the struggles of the prey and further jaw movements work it inwards and the caecilian usually retreats into its burrow the subdued prey is gulped down whole when they are newly hatched frog larvae feed on the yolk of the egg when this is exhausted some move on to feed on bacteria algal crusts detritus and raspings from submerged plants water is drawn in through their mouths which are usually at the bottom of their heads and passes through branchial food traps between their mouths and their gills where fine particles are trapped in mucus and filtered out others have specialised mouthparts consisting of a horny beak edged by several rows of labial teeth they scrape and bite food of many kinds as well as stirring up the bottom sediment filtering out larger particles with the papillae around their mouths some such as the spadefoot toads have strong biting jaws and are carnivorous or even cannibalistic
36,amphibians are ectothermic tetrapod vertebrates of the class amphibia modern amphibians are all lissamphibia they inhabit a wide variety of habitats with most species living within terrestrial fossorial arboreal or freshwater aquatic ecosystems thus amphibians typically start out as larvae living in water but some species have developed behavioural adaptations to bypass this the young generally undergo metamorphosis from larva with gills to an adult airbreathing form with lungs amphibians use their skin as a secondary respiratory surface and some small terrestrial salamanders and frogs lack lungs and rely entirely on their skin they are superficially similar to lizards but along with mammals and birds reptiles are amniotes and do not require water bodies in which to breed with their complex reproductive needs and permeable skins amphibians are often ecological indicators in recent decades there has been a dramatic decline in amphibian populations for many species around the globe the earliest amphibians evolved in the devonian period from sarcopterygian fish with lungs and bonylimbed fins features that were helpful in adapting to dry land they diversified and became dominant during the carboniferous and permian periods but were later displaced by reptiles and other vertebrates over time amphibians shrank in size and decreased in diversity leaving only the modern subclass lissamphibia the three modern orders of amphibians are anura the frogs and toads urodela the salamanders and apoda the caecilians the number of known amphibian species is approximately 7000 of which nearly 90 are frogs the smallest amphibian and vertebrate in the world is a frog from new guinea paedophryne amauensis with a length of just the largest living amphibian is the chinese giant salamander andrias davidianus but this is dwarfed by the extinct prionosuchus from the middle permian of brazil the study of amphibians is called batrachology while the study of both reptiles and amphibians is called herpetology
36,male orangethighed frog litoria xanthomera grasping the female during amplexus for the purpose of reproduction most amphibians require fresh water although some lay their eggs on land and have developed various means of keeping them moist a few eg fejervarya raja can inhabit brackish water but there are no true marine amphibians there are reports however of particular amphibian populations unexpectedly invading marine waters such was the case with the black sea invasion of the natural hybrid pelophylax esculentus reported in 2010 several hundred frog species in adaptive radiations eg eleutherodactylus the pacific platymantis the australopapuan microhylids and many other tropical frogs however do not need any water for breeding in the wild they reproduce via direct development an ecological and evolutionary adaptation that has allowed them to be completely independent from freestanding water almost all of these frogs live in wet tropical rainforests and their eggs hatch directly into miniature versions of the adult passing through the tadpole stage within the egg reproductive success of many amphibians is dependent not only on the quantity of rainfall but the seasonal timing in the tropics many amphibians breed continuously or at any time of year in temperate regions breeding is mostly seasonal usually in the spring and is triggered by increasing day length rising temperatures or rainfall experiments have shown the importance of temperature but the trigger event especially in arid regions is often a storm in anurans males usually arrive at the breeding sites before females and the vocal chorus they produce may stimulate ovulation in females and the endocrine activity of males that are not yet reproductively active in caecilians fertilisation is internal the male extruding an intromittent organ the phallodeum and inserting it into the female cloaca the paired müllerian glands inside the male cloaca secrete a fluid which resembles that produced by mammalian prostate glands and which may transport and nourish the sperm fertilisation probably takes place in the oviduct the majority of salamanders also engage in internal fertilisation in most of these the male deposits a spermatophore a small packet of sperm on top of a gelatinous cone on the substrate either on land or in the water the female takes up the sperm packet by grasping it with the lips of the cloaca and pushing it into the vent the spermatozoa move to the spermatheca in the roof of the cloaca where they remain until ovulation which may be many months later courtship rituals and methods of transfer of the spermatophore vary between species in some the spermatophore may be placed directly into the female cloaca while in others the female may be guided to the spermatophore or restrained with an embrace called amplexus certain primitive salamanders in the families sirenidae hynobiidae and cryptobranchidae practice external fertilisation in a similar manner to frogs with the female laying the eggs in water and the male releasing sperm onto the egg mass with a few exceptions frogs use external fertilisation the male grasps the female tightly with his forelimbs either behind the arms or in front of the back legs or in the case of epipedobates tricolor around the neck they remain in amplexus with their cloacae positioned close together while the female lays the eggs and the male covers them with sperm roughened nuptial pads on the males hands aid in retaining grip often the male collects and retains the egg mass forming a sort of basket with the hind feet an exception is the granular poison frog oophaga granulifera where the male and female place their cloacae in close proximity while facing in opposite directions and then release eggs and sperm simultaneously the tailed frog ascaphus truei exhibits internal fertilisation the tail is only possessed by the male and is an extension of the cloaca and used to inseminate the female this frog lives in fastflowing streams and internal fertilisation prevents the sperm from being washed away before fertilisation occurs the sperm may be retained in storage tubes attached to the oviduct until the following spring most frogs can be classified as either prolonged or explosive breeders typically prolonged breeders congregate at a breeding site the males usually arriving first calling and setting up territories other satellite males remain quietly nearby waiting for their opportunity to take over a territory the females arrive sporadically mate selection takes place and eggs are laid the females depart and territories may change hands more females appear and in due course the breeding season comes to an end explosive breeders on the other hand are found where temporary pools appear in dry regions after rainfall these frogs are typically fossorial species that emerge after heavy rains and congregate at a breeding site they are attracted there by the calling of the first male to find a suitable place perhaps a pool that forms in the same place each rainy season the assembled frogs may call in unison and frenzied activity ensues the males scrambling to mate with the usually smaller number of females sexual selection has been studied in the red back salamander there is a direct competition between males to win the attention of the females in salamanders and newts with elaborate courtship displays to keep the females attention long enough to get her interested in choosing him to mate with some species store sperm through long breeding seasons as the extra time may allow for interactions with rival sperm
36,cane toad rhinella marina with poison glands behind the eyes amphibians have soft bodies with thin skins and lack claws defensive armour or spines nevertheless they have evolved various defence mechanisms to keep themselves alive the first line of defence in salamanders and frogs is the mucous secretion that they produce this keeps their skin moist and makes them slippery and difficult to grip the secretion is often sticky and distasteful or toxic snakes have been observed yawning and gaping when trying to swallow african clawed frogs xenopus laevis which gives the frogs an opportunity to escape caecilians have been little studied in this respect but the cayenne caecilian typhlonectes compressicauda produces toxic mucus that has killed predatory fish in a feeding experiment in brazil in some salamanders the skin is poisonous the roughskinned newt taricha granulosa from north america and other members of its genus contain the neurotoxin tetrodotoxin ttx the most toxic nonprotein substance known and almost identical to that produced by pufferfish handling the newts does not cause harm but ingestion of even the most minute amounts of the skin is deadly in feeding trials fish frogs reptiles birds and mammals were all found to be susceptible the only predators with some tolerance to the poison are certain populations of common garter snake thamnophis sirtalis in locations where both snake and salamander coexist the snakes have developed immunity through genetic changes and they feed on the amphibians with impunity coevolution occurs with the newt increasing its toxic capabilities at the same rate as the snake further develops its immunity some frogs and toads are toxic the main poison glands being at the side of the neck and under the warts on the back these regions are presented to the attacking animal and their secretions may be foultasting or cause various physical or neurological symptoms altogether over 200 toxins have been isolated from the limited number of amphibian species that have been investigated the fire salamander salamandra salamandra a toxic species wears warning colours perhaps the most poisonous animal in the world the golden poison frog phyllobates terribilis is endemic to colombia poisonous species often use bright colouring to warn potential predators of their toxicity these warning colours tend to be red or yellow combined with black with the fire salamander salamandra salamandra being an example once a predator has sampled one of these it is likely to remember the colouration next time it encounters a similar animal in some species such as the firebellied toad bombina spp the warning colouration is on the belly and these animals adopt a defensive pose when attacked exhibiting their bright colours to the predator the frog allobates zaparo is not poisonous but mimics the appearance of other toxic species in its locality a strategy that may deceive predators many amphibians are nocturnal and hide during the day thereby avoiding diurnal predators that hunt by sight other amphibians use camouflage to avoid being detected they have various colourings such as mottled browns greys and olives to blend into the background some salamanders adopt defensive poses when faced by a potential predator such as the north american northern shorttailed shrew blarina brevicauda their bodies writhe and they raise and lash their tails which makes it difficult for the predator to avoid contact with their poisonproducing granular glands a few salamanders will autotomise their tails when attacked sacrificing this part of their anatomy to enable them to escape the tail may have a constriction at its base to allow it to be easily detached the tail is regenerated later but the energy cost to the animal of replacing it is significant some frogs and toads inflate themselves to make themselves look large and fierce and some spadefoot toads pelobates spp scream and leap towards the attacker giant salamanders of the genus andrias as well as ceratophrine and pyxicephalus frogs possess sharp teeth and are capable of drawing blood with a defensive bite the blackbelly salamander desmognathus quadramaculatus can bite an attacking common garter snake thamnophis sirtalis two or three times its size on the head and often manages to escape
36,little is known of the territorial behaviour of caecilians but some frogs and salamanders defend home ranges these are usually feeding breeding or sheltering sites males normally exhibit such behaviour though in some species females and even juveniles are also involved although in many frog species females are larger than males this is not the case in most species where males are actively involved in territorial defence some of these have specific adaptations such as enlarged teeth for biting or spines on the chest arms or thumbs the red back salamander plethodon cinereus defends a territory against intruders in salamanders defence of a territory involves adopting an aggressive posture and if necessary attacking the intruder this may involve snapping chasing and sometimes biting occasionally causing the loss of a tail the behaviour of red back salamanders plethodon cinereus has been much studied 91 of marked individuals that were later recaptured were within a metre yard of their original daytime retreat under a log or rock a similar proportion when moved experimentally a distance of found their way back to their home base the salamanders left odour marks around their territories which averaged in size and were sometimes inhabited by a male and female pair these deterred the intrusion of others and delineated the boundaries between neighbouring areas much of their behaviour seemed stereotyped and did not involve any actual contact between individuals an aggressive posture involved raising the body off the ground and glaring at the opponent who often turned away submissively if the intruder persisted a biting lunge was usually launched at either the tail region or the nasolabial grooves damage to either of these areas can reduce the fitness of the rival either because of the need to regenerate tissue or because it impairs its ability to detect food in frogs male territorial behaviour is often observed at breeding locations calling is both an announcement of ownership of part of this resource and an advertisement call to potential mates in general a deeper voice represents a heavier and more powerful individual and this may be sufficient to prevent intrusion by smaller males much energy is used in the vocalization and it takes a toll on the territory holder who may be displaced by a fitter rival if he tires there is a tendency for males to tolerate the holders of neighbouring territories while vigorously attacking unknown intruders holders of territories have a home advantage and usually come off better in an encounter between two similarsized frogs if threats are insufficient chest to chest tussles may take place fighting methods include pushing and shoving deflating the opponents vocal sac seizing him by the head jumping on his back biting chasing splashing and ducking him under the water
36,the first major groups of amphibians developed in the devonian period around 370 million years ago from lobefinned fish which were similar to the modern coelacanth and lungfish these ancient lobefinned fish had evolved multijointed leglike fins with digits that enabled them to crawl along the sea bottom some fish had developed primitive lungs to help them breathe air when the stagnant pools of the devonian swamps were low in oxygen they could also use their strong fins to hoist themselves out of the water and onto dry land if circumstances so required eventually their bony fins would evolve into limbs and they would become the ancestors to all tetrapods including modern amphibians reptiles birds and mammals despite being able to crawl on land many of these prehistoric tetrapodomorph fish still spent most of their time in the water they had started to develop lungs but still breathed predominantly with gills many examples of species showing transitional features have been discovered ichthyostega was one of the first primitive amphibians with nostrils and more efficient lungs it had four sturdy limbs a neck a tail with fins and a skull very similar to that of the lobefinned fish eusthenopteron amphibians evolved adaptations that allowed them to stay out of the water for longer periods their lungs improved and their skeletons became heavier and stronger better able to support the weight of their bodies on land they developed hands and feet with five or more digits the skin became more capable of retaining body fluids and resisting desiccation the fishs hyomandibula bone in the hyoid region behind the gills diminished in size and became the stapes of the amphibian ear an adaptation necessary for hearing on dry land an affinity between the amphibians and the teleost fish is the multifolded structure of the teeth and the paired supraoccipital bones at the back of the head neither of these features being found elsewhere in the animal kingdom the permian lepospondyl diplocaulus was largely aquatic at the end of the devonian period 360 million years ago the seas rivers and lakes were teeming with life while the land was the realm of early plants and devoid of vertebrates though some such as ichthyostega may have sometimes hauled themselves out of the water it is thought they may have propelled themselves with their forelimbs dragging their hindquarters in a similar manner to that used by the elephant seal in the early carboniferous 360 to 345 million years ago the climate became wet and warm extensive swamps developed with mosses ferns horsetails and calamites airbreathing arthropods evolved and invaded the land where they provided food for the carnivorous amphibians that began to adapt to the terrestrial environment there were no other tetrapods on the land and the amphibians were at the top of the food chain occupying the ecological position currently held by the crocodile though equipped with limbs and the ability to breathe air most still had a long tapering body and strong tail they were the top land predators sometimes reaching several metres in length preying on the large insects of the period and the many types of fish in the water they still needed to return to water to lay their shellless eggs and even most modern amphibians have a fully aquatic larval stage with gills like their fish ancestors it was the development of the amniotic egg which prevents the developing embryo from drying out that enabled the reptiles to reproduce on land and which led to their dominance in the period that followed after the carboniferous rainforest collapse amphibian dominance gave way to reptiles and amphibians were further devastated by the permiantriassic extinction event during the triassic period 250 to 200 million years ago the reptiles continued to outcompete the amphibians leading to a reduction in both the amphibians size and their importance in the biosphere according to the fossil record lissamphibia which includes all modern amphibians and is the only surviving lineage may have branched off from the extinct groups temnospondyli and lepospondyli at some period between the late carboniferous and the early triassic the relative scarcity of fossil evidence precludes precise dating but the most recent molecular study based on multilocus sequence typing suggests a late carboniferousearly permian origin for extant amphibians the temnospondyl eryops had sturdy limbs to support its body on land the origins and evolutionary relationships between the three main groups of amphibians is a matter of debate a 2005 molecular phylogeny based on rdna analysis suggests that salamanders and caecilians are more closely related to each other than they are to frogs it also appears that the divergence of the three groups took place in the paleozoic or early mesozoic around 250 million years ago before the breakup of the supercontinent pangaea and soon after their divergence from the lobefinned fish the briefness of this period and the swiftness with which radiation took place would help account for the relative scarcity of primitive amphibian fossils there are large gaps in the fossil record but the discovery of a protofrog from the early permian in texas in 2008 provided a missing link with many of the characteristics of modern frogs molecular analysis suggests that the frogsalamander divergence took place considerably earlier than the palaeontological evidence indicates newer research indicates that the common ancestor of all lissamphibians lived about 315 million years ago and that stereospondyls are the closest relatives to the caecilians as they evolved from lunged fish amphibians had to make certain adaptations for living on land including the need to develop new means of locomotion in the water the sideways thrusts of their tails had propelled them forward but on land quite different mechanisms were required their vertebral columns limbs limb girdles and musculature needed to be strong enough to raise them off the ground for locomotion and feeding terrestrial adults discarded their lateral line systems and adapted their sensory systems to receive stimuli via the medium of the air they needed to develop new methods to regulate their body heat to cope with fluctuations in ambient temperature they developed behaviours suitable for reproduction in a terrestrial environment their skins were exposed to harmful ultraviolet rays that had previously been absorbed by the water the skin changed to become more protective and prevent excessive water loss

nation according to a 2013 study by phoenix marketing international alaska had the fifthlargest number of millionaires per capita in the united states with a ratio of 675 percent the oil and gas industry dominates the alaskan economy with more than 80 of the states revenues derived from petroleum extraction alaskas main export product excluding oil and natural gas is seafood primarily salmon cod pollock and crab agriculture represents a very small fraction of the alaskan economy agricultural production is primarily for consumption within the state and includes nursery stock dairy products vegetables and livestock manufacturing is limited with most foodstuffs and general goods imported from elsewhere employment is primarily in government and industries such as natural resource extraction shipping and transportation military bases are a significant component of the economy in the fairbanks north star anchorage and kodiak island boroughs as well as kodiak federal subsidies are also an important part of the economy allowing the state to keep taxes low its industrial outputs are crude petroleum natural gas coal gold precious metals zinc and other mining seafood processing timber and wood products there is also a growing service and tourism sector tourists have contributed to the economy by supporting local lodging energy the transalaska pipeline transports oil alaskas most financially important export from the north slope to valdez pertinent are the heat pipes in the column mounts which disperse heat upwards and prevent melting of permafrost alaska has vast energy resources although its oil reserves have been largely depleted major oil and gas reserves were found in the alaska north slope ans and cook inlet basins but according to the energy information administration by february 2014 alaska had fallen to fourth place in the nation in crude oil production after texas north dakota and california prudhoe bay on alaskas north slope is still the second highestyielding oil field in the united states typically producing about although by early 2014 north dakotas bakken formation was producing over prudhoe bay was the largest conventional oil field

reserves at that rate the transalaska pipeline can transport and pump up to of crude oil per day more than any other crude oil pipeline in the united states additionally substantial coal deposits are found in alaskas bituminous subbituminous and lignite coal basins the united states geological survey estimates that there are of undiscovered technically recoverable gas from natural gas hydrates on the alaskan north slope alaska also offers some of the highest hydroelectric power potential in the country from its numerous rivers large swaths of the alaskan coastline offer wind and geothermal energy potential as well alaskas economy depends heavily on increasingly expensive diesel fuel for heating transportation electric power and light though wind and hydroelectric power are abundant and underdeveloped proposals for statewide energy systems eg with special lowcost electric interties were judged uneconomical at the time of the report 2001 due to low less than 50gal fuel prices long distances and low population the cost of a gallon of gas in urban alaska today is usually 3060 higher than the national average prices in rural areas are generally significantly higher but vary widely depending on transportation costs seasonal usage peaks nearby petroleum development infrastructure and many other factors permanent fund the alaska permanent fund is a constitutionally authorized appropriation of oil revenues established by voters in 1976 to manage a surplus in state petroleum revenues from oil largely in anticipation of the then recently constructed transalaska pipeline system the fund was originally proposed by governor keith miller on the eve of the 1969 prudhoe bay lease sale out of fear that the legislature would spend the entire proceeds of the sale which amounted to 900 million at once it was later championed by governor jay hammond and kenai state representative hugh malone it has served as an attractive political prospect ever since diverting revenues which would normally be deposited into the general fund the alaska constitution was written so as to discourage dedicating state funds for a particular purpose the permanent fund has become the rare exception to this mostly due to the political climate of distrust existing during the time of its creation from its initial principal of 734000 the fund has grown to 50 billion as a result of oil royalties and capital investment programs most if not all the principal is invested conservatively outside alaska this has led to frequent calls by alaskan politicians for the fund to make investments within alaska though such a stance has never gained momentum starting in 1982 dividends from the funds annual growth have been paid out each year to eligible alaskans ranging from an initial 1000 in 1982 equal to three years payout as the distribution of payments was held up in a lawsuit over the distribution scheme to 3269 in 2008 which included a onetime 1200 resource rebate every year the state legislature takes out 8 from the earnings puts 3 back into the principal for inflation proofing and the remaining 5 is distributed to all qualifying alaskans to qualify for the permanent fund dividend one must have lived in the state for a minimum of 12 months maintain constant residency subject to allowable absences and not be subject to court judgments or criminal convictions which fall under various disqualifying classifications or may subject the payment amount to civil garnishment the permanent fund is often considered to be one of the leading examples of a basic income policy in the world cost of living the cost of goods in alaska has long been higher than in the contiguous 48 states federal government employees particularly united states postal service usps workers and activeduty military members receive a cost of living allowance usually set at 25 of base pay because while the cost of living has gone down it is still one of the highest in the country rural alaska suffers from extremely high prices for food and consumer goods compared to the rest of the country due to the relatively limited transportation infrastructure agriculture and fishing halibut is important to the states economy as both a commercial and sportcaught fish due to the northern climate and short growing season relatively little farming occurs in alaska most farms are in either the matanuska valley about northeast of anchorage or on the kenai peninsula about southwest of anchorage the short 100day growing season limits the crops that can be grown but the long sunny summer days make for productive growing seasons the primary crops are potatoes carrots lettuce and cabbage the tanana valley is another notable agricultural locus especially the delta junction area about southeast of fairbanks with a sizable concentration of farms growing agronomic crops these farms mostly lie north and east of fort greely this area was largely set aside and developed under a state program spearheaded by hammond during his second term as governor deltaarea crops consist predominately of barley and hay west of fairbanks lies another concentration of small farms catering to restaurants the hotel and tourist industry and communitysupported agriculture alaskan agriculture has experienced a surge in growth of market gardeners small farms and farmers markets in recent years with the highest percentage increase 46 in the nation in growth in farmers markets in 2011 compared to 17 nationwide the peony industry has also taken off as the growing season allows farmers to harvest during a gap in supply elsewhere in the world thereby filling a niche in the flower market alaska with no counties lacks county fairs however a small assortment of state and local fairs with the alaska state fair in palmer the largest are held mostly in the late summer the fairs are mostly located in communities with historic or current agricultural activity and feature local farmers exhibiting produce in addition to more highprofile commercial activities such as carnival rides concerts and food alaska grown is used as an agricultural slogan alaska has an abundance of seafood with the primary fisheries in the bering sea and the north pacific seafood is one of the few food items that is often cheaper within the state than outside it many alaskans take advantage of salmon seasons to harvest portions of their household diet while fishing for subsistence as well as sport this includes fish taken by hook net or wheel hunting for subsistence primarily caribou moose and dall sheep is still common in the state particularly in remote bush communities an example of a traditional native food is akutaq the eskimo ice cream which can consist of reindeer fat seal oil dried fish meat and local berries alaskas reindeer herding is concentrated on seward peninsula where wild caribou can be prevented from mingling and migrating with the domesticated reindeer most food in alaska is transported into the state from outside and shipping costs make food in the cities relatively expensive in rural areas subsistence hunting and gathering is an essential activity because imported food is prohibitively expensive though most small towns and villages in alaska lie along the coastline the cost of importing food to remote villages can be high because of the terrain and difficult road conditions which change dramatically due to varying climate and precipitation changes the cost of transport can reach as high as 50 per pound 110kg or more in some remote areas during the most difficult times if these locations can be reached at all during such inclement weather and terrain conditions the cost of delivering a of milk is about 350 in many villages where per capita income can be 20000 or less fuel cost per gallon is routinely 2030 higher than the continental united states average with only hawaii having higher prices

37,the sterling highway near its intersection with the seward highway roads the susitna river bridge on the denali highway is long alaska interstate highways alaska has few road connections compared to the rest of the us the states road system covers a relatively small area of the state linking the central population centers and the alaska highway the principal route out of the state through canada the state capital juneau is not accessible by road only a car ferry which has spurred several debates over the decades about moving the capital to a city on the road system or building a road connection from haines the western part of alaska has no road system connecting the communities with the rest of alaska one unique feature of the alaska highway system is the anton anderson memorial tunnel an active alaska railroad tunnel recently upgraded to provide a paved roadway link with the isolated community of whittier on prince william sound to the seward highway about southeast of anchorage at portage at the tunnel was the longest road tunnel in north america until 2007 the tunnel is the longest combination road and rail tunnel in north america rail an alaska railroad locomotive and tanker cars crossing the george parks highway in 1994 the white pass and yukon route traverses rugged terrain north of skagway near the canadaus border built around 1915 the alaska railroad arr played a key role in the development of alaska through the 20th century it links north pacific shipping through providing critical infrastructure with tracks that run from seward to interior alaska by way of south central alaska passing through anchorage eklutna wasilla talkeetna denali and fairbanks with spurs to whittier palmer and north pole the cities towns villages and region served by arr tracks are known statewide as the railbelt in recent years the everimproving paved highway system began to eclipse the railroads importance in alaskas economy the railroad played a vital role in alaskas development moving freight into alaska while transporting natural resources southward ie coal from the usibelli coal mine near healy to seward and gravel from the matanuska valley to anchorage it is well known for its summertime tour passenger service the alaska railroad was one of the last railroads in north america to use cabooses in regular service and still uses them on some gravel trains it continues to offer one of the last flag stop routes in the country a stretch of about of track along an area north of talkeetna remains inaccessible by road the railroad provides the only transportation to rural homes and cabins in the area until construction of the parks highway in the 1970s the railroad provided the only land access to most of the region along its entire route in northern southeast alaska the white pass and yukon route also partly runs through the state from skagway northwards into canada british columbia and yukon territory crossing the border at white pass summit this line is now mainly used by tourists often arriving by cruise liner at skagway it was featured in the 1983 bbc television series great little railways the alaska rail network is not connected to outside in 2000 the us congress authorized 6 million to study the feasibility of a rail link between alaska canada and the lower 48 alaska rail marine provides car float service between whittier and seattle marine transport many cities towns and villages in the state do not have road or highway access the only modes of access involve travel by air river or the sea the named after tustumena glacier is one of the states many ferries providing service between the kenai peninsula kodiak island and the aleutian chain alaskas welldeveloped stateowned ferry system known as the alaska marine highway serves the cities of southeast the gulf coast and the alaska peninsula the ferries transport vehicles as well as passengers the system also operates a ferry service from bellingham washington and prince rupert british columbia in canada through the inside passage to skagway the interisland ferry authority also serves as an important marine link for many communities in the prince of wales island region of southeast and works in concert with the alaska marine highway in recent years cruise lines have created a summertime tourism market mainly connecting the pacific northwest to southeast alaska and to a lesser degree towns along alaskas gulf coast the population of ketchikan may rise by over 10000 people on many days during the summer as up to four large cruise ships at a time can dock debarking thousands of passengers air transport cities not served by road sea or river can be reached only by air foot dogsled or snowmachine accounting for alaskas extremely well developed bush air servicesan alaskan novelty anchorage and to a lesser extent fairbanks is served by many major airlines because of limited highway access air travel remains the most efficient form of transportation in and out of the state anchorage recently completed extensive remodeling and construction at ted stevens anchorage international airport to help accommodate the upsurge in tourism in 20122013 alaska received almost 2 million visitors regular flights to most villages and towns within the state that are commercially viable are challenging to provide so they are heavily subsidized by the federal government through the essential air service program alaska airlines is the only major airline offering instate travel with jet service sometimes in combination cargo and passenger boeing 737400s from anchorage and fairbanks to regional hubs like bethel nome kotzebue dillingham kodiak and other larger communities as well as to major southeast and alaska peninsula communities a bombardier dash 8 operated by era alaska on approach to ted stevens anchorage international airport the bulk of remaining commercial flight offerings come from small regional commuter airlines such as ravn alaska penair and frontier flying service the smallest towns and villages must rely on scheduled or chartered bush flying services using general aviation aircraft such as the cessna caravan the most popular aircraft in use in the state much of this service can be attributed to the alaska bypass mail program which subsidizes bulk mail delivery to alaskan rural communities the program requires 70 of that subsidy to go to carriers who offer passenger service to the communities many communities have small air taxi services these operations originated from the demand for customized transport to remote areas perhaps the most quintessentially alaskan plane is the bush seaplane the worlds busiest seaplane base is lake hood located next to ted stevens anchorage international airport where flights bound for remote villages without an airstrip carry passengers cargo and many items from stores and warehouse clubs in 2006 alaska had the highest number of pilots per capita of any us state other transport another alaskan transportation method is the dogsled in modern times that is any time after the midlate 1920s dog mushing is more of a sport than a true means of transportation various races are held around the state but the best known is the iditarod trail sled dog race a trail from anchorage to nome although the distance varies from year to year the official distance is set at the race commemorates the famous 1925 serum run to nome in which mushers and dogs like togo and balto took muchneeded medicine to the diphtheriastricken community of nome when all other means of transportation had failed mushers from all over the world come to anchorage each march to compete for cash prizes and prestige the serum run is another sled dog race that more accurately follows the route of the famous 1925 relay leaving from the community of nenana southwest of fairbanks to nome in areas not served by road or rail primary transportation in summer is by allterrain vehicle and in winter by snowmobile or snow machine as it is commonly referred to in alaska data transport alaskas internet and other data transport systems are provided largely through the two major telecommunications companies gci and alaska communications gci owns and operates what it calls the alaska united fiber optic system and as of late 2011 alaska communications advertised that it has two fiber optic paths to the lower 48 and two more across alaska in january 2011 it was reported that a 1 billion project to connect asia and rural alaska was being planned aided in part by 350 million in stimulus from the federal government

studies done here have provided evidence for the settlement of north america by way of the bering land bridge the tlingit people developed a society with a matrilineal kinship system of property inheritance and descent in what is today southeast alaska along with parts of british columbia and the yukon also in southeast were the haida now well known for their unique arts the tsimshian people came to alaska from british columbia in 1887 when president grover cleveland and later the us congress granted them permission to settle on annette island and found the town of metlakatla all three of these peoples as well as other indigenous peoples of the pacific northwest coast experienced smallpox outbreaks from the late 18th through the mid19th century with the most devastating epidemics

according to this hypothesis in 1648 several koches of semyon dezhnyovs expedition came ashore in alaska by storm and founded this settlement this hypothesis is based on the testimony of chukchi geographer nikolai daurkin who had visited alaska in 17641765 and who had reported on a village on the kheuveren river populated by bearded men who pray to the icons some modern researchers associate kheuveren with koyuk river the first european vessel to reach alaska is generally held to be the st gabriel under the authority of the surveyor m s gvozdev and assistant navigator i fyodorov on august

38,tractor and chaser bin crop alteration has been practiced by humankind for thousands of years since the beginning of civilization altering crops through breeding practices changes the genetic makeup of a plant to develop crops with more beneficial characteristics for humans for example larger fruits or seeds droughttolerance or resistance to pests significant advances in plant breeding ensued after the work of geneticist gregor mendel his work on dominant and recessive alleles although initially largely ignored for almost 50 years gave plant breeders a better understanding of genetics and breeding techniques crop breeding includes techniques such as plant selection with desirable traits selfpollination and crosspollination and molecular techniques that genetically modify the organism domestication of plants has over the centuries increased yield improved disease resistance and drought tolerance eased harvest and improved the taste and nutritional value of crop plants careful selection and breeding have had enormous effects on the characteristics of crop plants plant selection and breeding in the 1920s and 1930s improved pasture grasses and clover in new zealand extensive xray and ultraviolet induced mutagenesis efforts ie primitive genetic engineering during the 1950s produced the modern commercial varieties of grains such as wheat corn maize and barley the green revolution popularized the use of conventional hybridization to sharply increase yield by creating highyielding varieties for example average yields of corn maize in the usa have increased from around 25 tons per hectare tha 40 bushels per acre in 1900 to about 94 tha 150 bushels per acre in 2001 similarly worldwide average wheat yields have increased from less than 1 tha in 1900 to more than 25 tha in 1990 south american average wheat yields are around 2 tha african under 1 tha and egypt and arabia up to 35 to 4 tha with irrigation in contrast the average wheat yield in countries such as france is over 8 tha variations in yields are due mainly to variation in climate genetics and the level of intensive farming techniques use of fertilizers chemical pest control growth control to avoid lodging genetic engineering genetically modified organisms gmo are organisms whose genetic material has been altered by genetic engineering techniques generally known as recombinant dna technology genetic engineering has expanded the genes available to breeders to utilize in creating desired germlines for new crops increased durability nutritional content insect and virus resistance and herbicide tolerance are a few of the attributes bred into crops through genetic engineering for some gmo crops cause food safety and food labeling concerns numerous countries have placed restrictions on the production import or use of gmo foods and crops which have been put in place due to concerns over potential health issues declining agricultural diversity and contamination of nongmo crops currently a global treaty the biosafety protocol regulates the trade of gmos there is ongoing discussion regarding the labeling of foods made from gmos and while the eu currently requires all gmo foods to be labeled the us does not herbicideresistant seed has a gene implanted into its genome that allows the plants to tolerate exposure to herbicides including glyphosates these seeds allow the farmer to grow a crop that can be sprayed with herbicides to control weeds without harming the resistant crop herbicidetolerant crops are used by farmers worldwide with the increasing use of herbicidetolerant crops comes an increase in the use of glyphosatebased herbicide sprays in some areas glyphosate resistant weeds have developed causing farmers to switch to other herbicides some studies also link widespread glyphosate usage to iron deficiencies in some crops which is both a crop production and a nutritional quality concern with potential economic and health implications other gmo crops used by growers include insectresistant crops which have a gene from the soil bacterium bacillus thuringiensis bt which produces a toxin specific to insects these crops protect plants from damage by insects some believe that similar or better pestresistance traits can be acquired through traditional breeding practices and resistance to various pests can be gained through hybridization or crosspollination with wild species in some cases wild species are the primary source of resistance traits some tomato cultivars that have gained resistance to at least 19 diseases did so through crossing with wild populations of tomatoes
38,water pollution in a rural stream due to runoff from farming activity in new zealand agriculture as implemented through the method of farming imposes external costs upon society through pesticides nutrient runoff excessive water usage loss of natural environment and assorted other problems a 2000 assessment of agriculture in the uk determined total external costs for 1996 of 2343 million or 208 per hectare a 2005 analysis of these costs in the usa concluded that cropland imposes approximately 5 to 16 billion 30 to 96 per hectare while livestock production imposes 714 million both studies which focused solely on the fiscal impacts concluded that more should be done to internalize external costs neither included subsidies in their analysis but they noted that subsidies also influence the cost of agriculture to society in 2010 the international resource panel of the united nations environment programme published a report assessing the environmental impacts of consumption and production the study found that agriculture and food consumption are two of the most important drivers of environmental pressures particularly habitat change climate change water use and toxic emissions the 2011 unep green economy report states that agricultural operations excluding land use changes produce approximately 13 per cent of anthropogenic global ghg emissions this includes ghgs emitted by the use of inorganic fertilisers agrochemical pesticides and herbicides ghg emissions resulting from production of these inputs are included in industrial emissions and fossil fuelenergy inputs on average we find that the total amount of fresh residues from agricultural and forestry production for second generation biofuel production amounts to 38 billion tonnes per year between 2011 and 2050 with an average annual growth rate of 11 per cent throughout the period analysed accounting for higher growth during early years 48 per cent for 20112020 and an average 2 per cent annual expansion after 2020 livestock issues a senior un official and coauthor of a un report detailing this problem henning steinfeld said livestock are one of the most significant contributors to todays most serious environmental problems livestock production occupies 70 of all land used for agriculture or 30 of the land surface of the planet it is one of the largest sources of greenhouse gases responsible for 18 of the worlds greenhouse gas emissions as measured in co2 equivalents by comparison all transportation emits 135 of the co2 it produces 65 of humanrelated nitrous oxide which has 296 times the global warming potential of co2 and 37 of all humaninduced methane which is 23 times as warming as co2 it also generates 64 of the ammonia emission livestock expansion is cited as a key factor driving deforestation in the amazon basin 70 of previously forested area is now occupied by pastures and the remainder used for feedcrops through deforestation and land degradation livestock is also driving reductions in biodiversity furthermore the unep states that methane emissions from global livestock are projected to increase by 60 per cent by 2030 under current practices and consumption patterns land and water issues land transformation the use of land to yield goods and services is the most substantial way humans alter the earths ecosystems and is considered the driving force in the loss of biodiversity estimates of the amount of land transformed by humans vary from 39 to 50 land degradation the longterm decline in ecosystem function and productivity is estimated to be occurring on 24 of land worldwide with cropland overrepresented the unfao report cites land management as the driving factor behind degradation and reports that 15 billion people rely upon the degrading land degradation can be deforestation desertification soil erosion mineral depletion or chemical degradation acidification and salinization eutrophication excessive nutrients in aquatic ecosystems resulting in algal blooms and anoxia leads to fish kills loss of biodiversity and renders water unfit for drinking and other industrial uses excessive fertilization and manure application to cropland as well as high livestock stocking densities cause nutrient mainly nitrogen and phosphorus runoff and leaching from agricultural land these nutrients are major nonpoint pollutants contributing to eutrophication of aquatic ecosystems agriculture accounts for 70 percent of withdrawals of freshwater resources agriculture is a major draw on water from aquifers and currently draws from those underground water sources at an unsustainable rate it is long known that aquifers in areas as diverse as northern china the upper ganges and the western us are being depleted and new research extends these problems to aquifers in iran mexico and saudi arabia increasing pressure is being placed on water resources by industry and urban areas meaning that water scarcity is increasing and agriculture is facing the challenge of producing more food for the worlds growing population with reduced water resources agricultural water usage can also cause major environmental problems including the destruction of natural wetlands the spread of waterborne diseases and land degradation through salinization and waterlogging when irrigation is performed incorrectly pesticides pesticide use has increased since 1950 to 25million short tons annually worldwide yet crop loss from pests has remained relatively constant the world health organization estimated in 1992 that 3million pesticide poisonings occur annually causing 220000 deaths pesticides select for pesticide resistance in the pest population leading to a condition termed the pesticide treadmill in which pest resistance warrants the development of a new pesticide an alternative argument is that the way to save the environment and prevent famine is by using pesticides and intensive high yield farming a view exemplified by a quote heading the center for global food issues website growing more per acre leaves more land for nature however critics argue that a tradeoff between the environment and a need for food is not inevitable and that pesticides simply replace good agronomic practices such as crop rotation the unep introduces the pushpull agricultural pest management technique which involves intercropping that uses plant aromas to repel or push away pests while pulling in or attracting the right insects the implementation of pushpull in eastern africa has significantly increased maize yields and the combined cultivation of nfixing forage crops has enriched the soil and has also provided farmers with feed for livestock with increased livestock operations the farmers are able to produce meat milk and other dairy products and they use the manure as organic fertiliser that returns nutrients to the fields climate change climate change has the potential to affect agriculture through changes in temperature rainfall timing and quantity co2 solar radiation and the interaction of these elements extreme events such as droughts and floods are forecast to increase as climate change takes hold agriculture is among sectors most vulnerable to the impacts of climate change water supply for example will be critical to sustain agricultural production and provide the increase in food output required to sustain the worlds growing population fluctuations in the flow of rivers are likely to increase in the twentyfirst century based on the experience of countries in the nile river basin ethiopia kenya and sudan and other developing countries depletion of water resources during seasons crucial for agriculture can lead to a decline in yield by up to 50 transformational approaches will be needed to manage natural resources in the future for example policies practices and tools promoting climatesmart agriculture will be important as will better use of scientific information on climate for assessing risks and vulnerability planners and policymakers will need to help create suitable policies that encourage funding for such agricultural transformation agriculture in its many forms can both mitigate or worsen global warming some of the increase in co2 in the atmosphere comes from the decomposition of organic matter in the soil and much of the methane emitted into the atmosphere is caused by the decomposition of organic matter in wet soils such as rice paddy fields as well as the normal digestive activities of farm animals further wet or anaerobic soils also lose nitrogen through denitrification releasing the greenhouse gases nitric oxide and nitrous oxide changes in management can reduce the release of these greenhouse gases and soil can further be used to sequester some of the co2 in the atmosphere informed by the unep agriculture also produces about 58 per cent of global nitrous oxide emissions and about 47 per cent of global methane emissions cattle and rice farms release methane fertilized fields release nitrous oxide and the cutting down of rainforests to grow crops or raise livestock releases carbon dioxide both of these gases have a far greater global warming potential per tonne than co2 298 times and 25 times respectively there are several factors within the field of agriculture that contribute to the large amount of co2 emissions the diversity of the sources ranges from the production of farming tools to the transport of harvested produce approximately 8 of the national carbon footprint is due to agricultural sources of that 75 is of the carbon emissions released from the production of crop assisting chemicals factories producing insecticides herbicides fungicides and fertilizers are a major culprit of the greenhouse gas productivity on the farm itself and the use of machinery is another source of the carbon emission almost all the industrial machines used in modern farming are powered by fossil fuels these instruments are burning fossil fuels from the beginning of the process to the end tractors are the root of this source the tractor is going to burn fuel and release co2 just to run the amount of emissions from the machinery increase with the attachment of different units and need for more power during the soil preparation stage tillers and plows will be used to disrupt the soil during growth watering pumps and sprayers are used to keep the crops hydrated and when the crops are ready for picking a forage or combine harvester is used these types of machinery all require additional energy which leads to increased carbon dioxide emissions from the basic tractors the final major contribution to co2 emissions in agriculture is in the final transport of produce local farming suffered a decline over the past century due to large amounts of farm subsidies the majority of crops are shipped hundreds of miles to various processing plants before ending up in the grocery store these shipments are made using fossil fuel burning modes of transportation inevitably these transport adds to carbon dioxide emissions sustainability some major organizations are hailing farming within agroecosystems as the way forward for mainstream agriculture current farming methods have resulted in overstretched water resources high levels of erosion and reduced soil fertility according to a report by the international water management institute and unep there is not enough water to continue farming using current practices therefore how critical water land and ecosystem resources are used to boost crop yields must be reconsidered the report suggested assigning value to ecosystems recognizing environmental and livelihood tradeoffs and balancing the rights of a variety of users and interests inequities that result when such measures are adopted would need to be addressed such as the reallocation of water from poor to rich the clearing of land to make way for more productive farmland or the preservation of a wetland system that limits fishing rights technological advancements help provide farmers with tools and resources to make farming more sustainable new technologies have given rise to innovations like conservation tillage a farming process which helps prevent land loss to erosion water pollution and enhances carbon sequestration according to a report by the international food policy research institute ifpri agricultural technologies will have the greatest impact on food production if adopted in combination with each other using a model that assessed how eleven technologies could impact agricultural productivity food security and trade by 2050 ifpri found that the number of people at risk from hunger could be reduced by as much as 40 and food prices could be reduced by almost half

38,reindeer herds form the basis of pastoral agriculture for several arctic and subarctic peoples pastoralism involves managing domesticated animals in nomadic pastoralism herds of livestock are moved from place to place in search of pasture fodder and water this type of farming is practised in arid and semiarid regions of sahara central asia and some parts of india in shifting cultivation a small area of a forest is cleared by cutting down all the trees and the area is burned the land is then used for growing crops for several years when the soil becomes less fertile the area is then abandoned another patch of land is selected and the process is repeated this type of farming is practiced mainly in areas with abundant rainfall where the forest regenerates quickly this practice is used in northeast india southeast asia and the amazon basin subsistence farming is practiced to satisfy family or local needs alone with little left over for transport elsewhere it is intensively practiced in monsoon asia and southeast asia in intensive farming the crops are cultivated for commercial purpose ie for selling the main motive of the farmer is to make profit with a low fallow ratio and a high use of inputs this type of farming is mainly practiced in highly developed countries
38,agricultural economics refers to economics as it relates to the production distribution and consumption of agricultural goods and services combining agricultural production with general theories of marketing and business as a discipline of study began in the late 1800s and grew significantly through the 20th century although the study of agricultural economics is relatively recent major trends in agriculture have significantly affected national and international economies throughout history ranging from tenant farmers and sharecropping in the postamerican civil war southern united states to the european feudal system of manorialism in the united states and elsewhere food costs attributed to food processing distribution and agricultural marketing sometimes referred to as the value chain have risen while the costs attributed to farming have declined this is related to the greater efficiency of farming combined with the increased level of value addition eg more highly processed products provided by the supply chain market concentration has increased in the sector as well and although the total effect of the increased market concentration is likely increased efficiency the changes redistribute economic surplus from producers farmers and consumers and may have negative implications for rural communities national government policies can significantly change the economic marketplace for agricultural products in the form of taxation subsidies tariffs and other measures since at least the 1960s a combination of importexport restrictions exchange rate policies and subsidies have affected farmers in both the developing and developed world in the 1980s it was clear that nonsubsidized farmers in developing countries were experiencing adverse effects from national policies that created artificially low global prices for farm products between the mid1980s and the early 2000s several international agreements were put into place that limited agricultural tariffs subsidies and other trade restrictions however there was still a significant amount of policydriven distortion in global agricultural product prices the three agricultural products with the greatest amount of trade distortion were sugar milk and rice mainly due to taxation among the oilseeds sesame had the greatest amount of taxation but overall feed grains and oilseeds had much lower levels of taxation than livestock products since the 1980s policydriven distortions have seen a greater decrease among livestock products than crops during the worldwide reforms in agricultural policy despite this progress certain crops such as cotton still see subsidies in developed countries artificially deflating global prices causing hardship in developing countries with nonsubsidized farmers unprocessed commodities ie corn soybeans cows are generally graded to indicate quality the quality affects the price the producer receives commodities are generally reported by production quantities such as volume number or weight

38,crop cultivation systems rice cultivation in andhra pradesh india cropping systems vary among farms depending on the available resources and constraints geography and climate of the farm government policy economic social and political pressures and the philosophy and culture of the farmer shifting cultivation or slash and burn is a system in which forests are burnt releasing nutrients to support cultivation of annual and then perennial crops for a period of several years then the plot is left fallow to regrow forest and the farmer moves to a new plot returning after many more years 1020 this fallow period is shortened if population density grows requiring the input of nutrients fertilizer or manure and some manual pest control annual cultivation is the next phase of intensity in which there is no fallow period this requires even greater nutrient and pest control inputs further industrialization led to the use of monocultures when one cultivar is planted on a large acreage because of the low biodiversity nutrient use is uniform and pests tend to build up necessitating the greater use of pesticides and fertilizers multiple cropping in which several crops are grown sequentially in one year and intercropping when several crops are grown at the same time are other kinds of annual cropping systems known as polycultures in subtropical and arid environments the timing and extent of agriculture may be limited by rainfall either not allowing multiple annual crops in a year or requiring irrigation in all of these environments perennial crops are grown coffee chocolate and systems are practiced such as agroforestry in temperate environments where ecosystems were predominantly grassland or prairie highly productive annual farming is the dominant agricultural system crop

grasslandbased mixed and landless 30 of earths ice and waterfree area was used for producing livestock with the sector employing approximately 13 billion people between the 1960s and the 2000s there was a significant increase in livestock production both by numbers and by carcass weight especially among beef pigs and chickens the latter of which had production increased by almost a factor of 10 nonmeat animals such as milk cows and eggproducing chickens also showed significant production increases global cattle sheep and goat populations are expected to continue to increase sharply through 2050 aquaculture or fish farming the production of fish for human consumption in confined operations is one of the fastest growing sectors of food production growing at an average of 9 a year between 1975 and 2007 during the second half of the 20th century producers using selective breeding focused on creating livestock breeds and crossbreeds that increased production while mostly disregarding the need to preserve genetic diversity this trend has led to a significant decrease in genetic diversity and resources among livestock breeds leading to a corresponding decrease in disease resistance and local adaptations previously found among traditional breeds grassland based livestock production relies upon plant material such as shrubland rangeland and pastures for feeding ruminant animals outside nutrient inputs may be used however manure is returned directly to the grassland as a major nutrient source this system is particularly important in areas where crop production is not feasible because of climate or soil representing 3040 million pastoralists mixed production systems use grassland fodder crops and grain feed crops as feed for ruminant and monogastric one stomach mainly chickens and pigs livestock manure is typically recycled in mixed systems as a fertilizer for crops landless systems rely upon feed from outside the farm representing the delinking of crop and livestock production found more prevalently in organisation for economic cooperation and developmentoecd member countries synthetic fertilizers are more heavily relied upon for crop production and manure utilization becomes a challenge as well as a source for pollution industrialized countries use these operations to produce much of the global supplies of poultry and pork scientists estimate that 75 of the growth in livestock production between 2003 and 2030 will be in confined animal feeding operations sometimes called factory farming much of this growth is happening in developing countries in asia with much smaller amounts of growth in africa some of the practices used in commercial livestock production including the usage of growth hormones are controversial

christopher isherwood to this circle not long after huxley wrote his book on widely held spiritual values and ideas the perennial philosophy which discussed the teachings of renowned mystics of the world huxleys book affirmed a sensibility that insists there are realities beyond the generally accepted five senses and that there is genuine meaning for humans beyond both sensual satisfactions and sentimentalities huxley became a close friend of remsen bird president of occidental college he spent much time at the college which is in the eagle rock neighbourhood of los angeles the college appears as tarzana college in his satirical novel after many a summer 1939 the novel won huxley a british literary award the 1939 james tait black memorial prize for fiction huxley also incorporated bird into the novel during this period huxley earned a substantial income as a hollywood screenwriter christopher isherwood in his autobiography my guru and his disciple states that huxley earned more than 3000 per week an enormous sum in those days as a screenwriter and that he used much of it to transport jewish and leftwing writer and artist refugees from hitlers germany to the us in march 1938 his friend anita loos a novelist and screenwriter put him in touch with metrogoldwynmayer who hired huxley for madame curie which was originally to star greta garbo and be directed by george cukor eventually the film was completed by mgm in 1943 with a different director and cast huxley received screen credit for pride and prejudice 1940 and was paid for his work on a number of other films including jane eyre 1944 huxley was commissioned by walt disney in 1945 to write a script based on alices adventures in wonderland and the biography of the storys author lewis carroll the script was not used however huxley wrote an introduction to the posthumous publication of j d unwins 1940 book hopousia or the sexual and economic foundations of a new society on 21 october 1949 huxley wrote to george orwell author of nineteen eightyfour congratulating him on how fine and how profoundly important the book is in his letter to orwell he predicted huxley had deeply felt apprehensions about the future the developed world might make for itself from these he made some warnings in his writings and talks in a 1958 televised interview conducted by journalist mike wallace huxley outlined several major concerns the difficulties and dangers of world overpopulation the tendency toward distinctly hierarchical social organisation the crucial importance of evaluating the use of technology in mass societies susceptible to wily persuasion the tendency to promote modern politicians to a naive public as wellmarketed commodities post world war ii in 1953 huxley and maria applied for united states citizenship and presented themselves for examination when huxley refused to bear arms for the us and would not state that his objections were based on religious ideals the only excuse allowed under the mccarran act the judge had to adjourn the proceedings he withdrew his application nevertheless he remained in the us in 1959 huxley turned down an offer of a knight bachelor by the macmillan government without putting forward a reason his brother julian had been knighted in 1958 while another brother andrew would be knighted in 1974

42,rhodophyta chlorophyta and heterokontophyta the three main algal divisions have lifecycles which show considerable variation and complexity in general an asexual phase exists where the seaweeds cells are diploid a sexual phase where the cells are haploid followed by fusion of the male and female gametes asexual reproduction permits efficient population increases but less variation is possible commonly in sexual reproduction of unicellular and colonial algae two specialized sexually compatible haploid gametes make physical contact and fuse to form a zygote to ensure a successful mating the development and release of gametes is highly synchronized and regulated pheromones may play a key role in these processes sexual reproduction allows for more variation and provides the benefit of efficient recombinational repair of dna damages during meiosis a key stage of the sexual cycle however sexual reproduction is more costly than asexual reproduction meiosis has been shown to occur in many different species of algae

42,the singular alga is the latin word for seaweed and retains that meaning in english the etymology is obscure although some speculate that it is related to latin algēre be cold no reason is known to associate seaweed with temperature a more likely source is alliga binding entwining the ancient greek word for seaweed was φῦκος phŷcos which could mean either the seaweed probably red algae or a red dye derived from it the latinization fūcus meant primarily the cosmetic rouge the etymology is uncertain but a strong candidate has long been some word related to the biblical פוך pūk paint if not that word itself a cosmetic eyeshadow used by the ancient egyptians and other inhabitants of the eastern mediterranean it could be any color black red green or blue accordingly the modern study of marine and freshwater algae is called either phycology or algology depending on whether the greek or latin root is used the name fucus appears in a number of taxa

amounts of toxic chemicals that would otherwise be needed algae can be used to capture fertilizers in runoff from farms when subsequently harvested the enriched algae can be used as fertilizer aquaria and ponds can be filtered using algae which absorb nutrients from the water in a device called an algae scrubber also known as an algae turf scrubber agricultural research service scientists found that 6090 of nitrogen runoff and 70100 of phosphorus runoff can be captured from manure effluents using a horizontal algae scrubber also called an algal turf scrubber ats scientists developed the ats which consists of shallow 100foot raceways of nylon netting where algae colonies can form and studied its efficacy for three years they found that algae can readily be used to reduce the nutrient runoff from agricultural fields and increase the quality of water flowing into rivers streams and oceans researchers collected and dried the nutrientrich algae from the ats and studied its potential as an organic fertilizer they found that cucumber and corn seedlings grew just as well using ats organic fertilizer as they did with commercial fertilizers algae scrubbers using bubbling upflow or vertical waterfall versions are now also being used to filter aquaria and ponds bioremediation the alga stichococcus bacillaris has been seen to colonize silicone resins used at archaeological sites

42,algae singular alga is an informal term for a large diverse group of photosynthetic organisms which are not necessarily closely related and is thus polyphyletic included organisms range from unicellular genera such as chlorella and the diatoms to multicellular forms such as the giant kelp a large brown alga which may grow up to 50 m in length most are aquatic and autotrophic and lack many of the distinct cell and tissue types such as stomata xylem and phloem which are found in land plants the largest and most complex marine algae are called seaweeds while the most complex freshwater forms are the charophyta a division of green algae which includes for example spirogyra and the stoneworts no definition of algae is generally accepted one definition is that algae have chlorophyll as their primary photosynthetic pigment and lack a sterile covering of cells around their reproductive cells some authors exclude all prokaryotes and thus do not consider cyanobacteria bluegreen algae as algae algae constitute a polyphyletic group since they do not include a common ancestor and although their plastids seem to have a single origin from cyanobacteria they were acquired in different ways green algae are examples of algae that have primary chloroplasts derived from endosymbiotic cyanobacteria diatoms and brown algae are examples of algae with secondary chloroplasts derived from an endosymbiotic red alga algae exhibit a wide range of reproductive strategies from simple asexual cell division to complex forms of sexual reproduction algae lack the various structures that characterize land plants such as the phyllids leaflike structures of bryophytes rhizoids in nonvascular plants and the roots leaves and other organs found in tracheophytes vascular plants most are phototrophic although some are mixotrophic deriving energy both from photosynthesis and uptake of organic carbon either by osmotrophy myzotrophy or phagotrophy some unicellular species of green algae many golden algae euglenids dinoflagellates and other algae have become heterotrophs also called colorless or apochlorotic algae sometimes parasitic relying entirely on external energy sources and have limited or no photosynthetic apparatus some other heterotrophic organisms such as the apicomplexans are also derived from cells whose ancestors possessed plastids but are not traditionally considered as algae algae have photosynthetic machinery ultimately derived from cyanobacteria that produce oxygen as a byproduct of photosynthesis unlike other photosynthetic bacteria such as purple and green sulfur bacteria fossilized filamentous algae from the vindhya basin have been dated back to 16 to 17 billion years ago
42,falsecolor scanning electron micrograph of the unicellular coccolithophore gephyrocapsa oceanica most algae contain chloroplasts that are similar in structure to cyanobacteria chloroplasts contain circular dna like that in cyanobacteria and presumably represent reduced endosymbiotic cyanobacteria however the exact origin of the chloroplasts is different among separate lineages of algae reflecting their acquisition during different endosymbiotic events the table below describes the composition of the three major groups of algae their lineage relationships are shown in the figure in the upper right many of these groups contain some members that are no longer photosynthetic some retain plastids but not chloroplasts while others have lost plastids entirely phylogeny based on plastid not nucleocytoplasmic genealogy supergroup affiliation members endosymbiont summary primoplantaearchaeplastida chlorophyta rhodophyta glaucophyta cyanobacteria these algae have primary chloroplasts ie the chloroplasts are surrounded by two membranes and probably developed through a single endosymbiotic event the chloroplasts of red algae have chlorophylls a and c often and phycobilins while those of green algae have chloroplasts with chlorophyll a and b without phycobilins land plants are pigmented similarly to green algae and probably developed from them thus the chlorophyta is a sister taxon to the plants sometimes the chlorophyta the charophyta and land plants are grouped together as the viridiplantae excavata and rhizaria chlorarachniophytes euglenids green algae these groups have green chloroplasts containing chlorophylls a and b their chloroplasts are surrounded by four and three membranes respectively and were probably retained from ingested green algae chlorarachniophytes which belong to the phylum cercozoa contain a small nucleomorph which is a relict of the algaes nucleus euglenids which belong to the phylum euglenozoa live primarily in fresh water and have chloroplasts with only three membranes the endosymbiotic green algae may have been acquired through myzocytosis rather than phagocytosis chromista and alveolata heterokonts haptophyta cryptomonads dinoflagellates red algae these groups have chloroplasts containing chlorophylls a and c and phycobilins the shape varies from plant to plant they may be of discoid platelike reticulate cupshaped spiral or ribbon shaped they have one or more pyrenoids to preserve protein and starch the latter chlorophyll type is not known from any prokaryotes or primary chloroplasts but genetic similarities with red algae suggest a relationship there in the first three of these groups chromista the chloroplast has four membranes retaining a nucleomorph in cryptomonads and they likely share a common pigmented ancestor although other evidence casts doubt on whether the heterokonts haptophyta and cryptomonads are in fact more closely related to each other than to other groups the typical dinoflagellate chloroplast has three membranes but considerable diversity exists in chloroplasts within the group and a number of endosymbiotic events apparently occurred the apicomplexa a group of closely related parasites also have plastids called apicoplasts which are not photosynthetic but appear to have a common origin with dinoflagellate chloroplasts gmelins historia fucorum dated 1768 linnaeus in species plantarum 1753 the starting point for modern botanical nomenclature recognized 14 genera of algae of which only four are currently considered among algae in systema naturae linnaeus described the genera volvox and corallina and a species of acetabularia as madrepora among the animals in 1768 samuel gottlieb gmelin 17441774 published the historia fucorum the first work dedicated to marine algae and the first book on marine biology to use the then new binomial nomenclature of linnaeus it included elaborate illustrations of seaweed and marine algae on folded leaves whharvey 18111866 and lamouroux 1813 were the first to divide macroscopic algae into four divisions based on their pigmentation this is the first use of a biochemical criterion in plant systematics harveys four divisions are red algae rhodospermae brown algae melanospermae green algae chlorospermae and diatomaceae at this time microscopic algae were discovered and reported by a different group of workers eg o f müller and ehrenberg studying the infusoria microscopic organisms unlike macroalgae which were clearly viewed as plants microalgae were frequently considered animals because they are often motile even the nonmotile coccoid microalgae were sometimes merely seen as stages of the lifecycle of plants macroalgae or animals although used as a taxonomic category in some predarwinian classifications eg linnaeus 1753 de jussieu 1789 horaninow 1843 agassiz 1859 wilson cassin 1864 in further classifications the algae are seen as an artificial polyphyletic group throughout the 20th century most classifications treated the following groups as divisions or classes of algae cyanophytes rhodophytes chrysophytes xanthophytes bacillariophytes phaeophytes pyrrhophytes cryptophytes and dinophytes euglenophytes and chlorophytes later many new groups were discovered eg bolidophyceae and others were splintered from older groups charophytes and glaucophytes from chlorophytes many heterokontophytes eg synurophytes from chrysophytes or eustigmatophytes from xanthophytes haptophytes from chrysophytes and chlorarachniophytes from xanthophytes with the abandonment of plantanimal dichotomous classification most groups of algae sometimes all were included in protista later also abandoned in favour of eukaryota however as a legacy of the older plant life scheme some groups that were also treated as protozoans in the past still have duplicated classifications see ambiregnal protists some parasitic algae eg the green algae prototheca and helicosporidium parasites of metazoans or cephaleuros parasites of plants were originally classified as fungi sporozoans or protistans of incertae sedis while others eg the green algae phyllosiphon and rhodochytrium parasites of plants or the red algae pterocladiophila and gelidiocolax mammillatus parasites of other red algae or the dinoflagellates oodinium parasites of fish had their relationship with algae conjectured early in other cases some groups were originally characterized as parasitic algae eg chlorochytrium but later were seen as endophytic algae some filamentous bacteria eg beggiatoa were originally seen as algae furthermore groups like the apicomplexans are also parasites derived from ancestors that possessed plastids but are not included in any group traditionally seen as algae
42,some species of algae form symbiotic relationships with other organisms in these symbioses the algae supply photosynthates organic substances to the host organism providing protection to the algal cells the host organism derives some or all of its energy requirements from the algae examples are lichens rock lichens in ireland lichens are defined by the international association for lichenology to be an association of a fungus and a photosynthetic symbiont resulting in a stable vegetative body having a specific structure the fungi or mycobionts are mainly from the ascomycota with a few from the basidiomycota they are not found alone in nature but when they began to associate is not known one mycobiont associates with the same phycobiont species rarely two from the green algae except that alternatively the mycobiont may associate with a species of cyanobacteria hence photobiont is the more accurate term a photobiont may be associated with many different mycobionts or may live independently accordingly lichens are named and classified as fungal species the association is termed a morphogenesis because the lichen has a form and capabilities not possessed by the symbiont species alone they can be experimentally isolated the photobiont possibly triggers otherwise latent genes in the mycobiont coral reefs floridian coral reef coral reefs are accumulated from the calcareous exoskeletons of marine invertebrates of the order scleractinia stony corals these animals metabolize sugar and oxygen to obtain energy for their cellbuilding processes including secretion of the exoskeleton with water and carbon dioxide as byproducts dinoflagellates algal protists are often endosymbionts in the cells of the coralforming marine invertebrates where they accelerate hostcell metabolism by generating immediately available sugar and oxygen through photosynthesis using incident light and the carbon dioxide produced by the host reefbuilding stony corals hermatypic corals require endosymbiotic algae from the genus symbiodinium to be in a healthy condition the loss of symbiodinium from the host is known as coral bleaching a condition which leads to the deterioration of a reef sea sponges green algae live close to the surface of some sponges for example breadcrumb sponge halichondria panicea the alga is thus protected from predators the sponge is provided with oxygen and sugars which can account for 50 to 80 of sponge growth in some species
42,the distribution of algal species has been fairly well studied since the founding of phytogeography in the mid19th century algae spread mainly by the dispersal of spores analogously to the dispersal of plantae by seeds and spores this dispersal can be accomplished by air water or other organisms due to this spores can be found in a variety of environments fresh and marine waters air soil and in or on other organisms whether a spore is to grow into an organism depends on the combination of the species and the environmental conditions where the spore lands the spores of freshwater algae are dispersed mainly by running water and wind as well as by living carriers however not all bodies of water can carry all species of algae as the chemical composition of certain water bodies limits the algae that can survive within them marine spores are often spread by ocean currents ocean water presents many vastly different habitats based on temperature and nutrient availability resulting in phytogeographic zones regions and provinces to some degree the distribution of algae is subject to floristic discontinuities caused by geographical features such as antarctica long distances of ocean or general land masses it is therefore possible to identify species occurring by locality such as pacific algae or north sea algae when they occur out of their localities hypothesizing a transport mechanism is usually possible such as the hulls of ships for example ulva reticulata and u fasciata travelled from the mainland to hawaii in this manner mapping is possible for select species only there are many valid examples of confined distribution patterns for example clathromorphum is an arctic genus and is not mapped far south of there however scientists regard the overall data as insufficient due to the difficulties of undertaking such studies
43,the calculations of anova can be characterized as computing a number of means and variances dividing two variances and comparing the ratio to a handbook value to determine statistical significance calculating a treatment effect is then trivial the effect of any treatment is estimated by taking the difference between the mean of the observations which receive the treatment and the general mean partitioning of the sum of squares anova uses traditional standardized terminology the definitional equation of sample variance is where the divisor is called the degrees of freedom df the summation is called the sum of squares ss the result is called the mean square ms and the squared terms are deviations from the sample mean anova estimates 3 sample variances a total variance based on all the observation deviations from the grand mean an error variance based on all the observation deviations from their appropriate treatment means and a treatment variance the treatment variance is based on the deviations of treatment means from the grand mean the result being multiplied by the number of observations in each treatment to account for the difference between the variance of observations and the variance of means the fundamental technique is a partitioning of the total sum of squares ss into components related to the effects used in the model for example the model for a simplified anova with one type of treatment at different levels the number of degrees of freedom df can be partitioned in a similar way one of these components that for error specifies a chisquared distribution which describes the associated sum of squares while the same is true for treatments if there is no treatment effect see also lackoffit sum of squares the ftest the ftest is used for comparing the factors of the total deviation for example in oneway or singlefactor anova statistical significance is tested for by comparing the f test statistic where ms is mean square number of treatments and total number of cases to the fdistribution with degrees of freedom using the fdistribution is a natural candidate because the test statistic is the ratio of two scaled sums of squares each of which follows a scaled chisquared distribution the expected value of f is where n is the treatment sample size which is 1 for no treatment effect as values of f increase above 1 the evidence is increasingly inconsistent with the null hypothesis two apparent experimental methods of increasing f are increasing the sample size and reducing the error variance by tight experimental controls there are two methods of concluding the anova hypothesis test both of which produce the same result the textbook method is to compare the observed value of f with the critical value of f determined from tables the critical value of f is a function of the degrees of freedom of the numerator and the denominator and the significance level α if f fcritical the null hypothesis is rejected the computer method calculates the probability pvalue of a value of f greater than or equal to the observed value the null hypothesis is rejected if this probability is less than or equal to the significance level α the anova ftest is known to be nearly optimal in the sense of minimizing false negative errors for a fixed rate of false positive errors ie maximizing power for a fixed significance level for example to test the hypothesis that various medical treatments have exactly the same effect the ftests pvalues closely approximate the permutation tests pvalues the approximation is particularly close when the design is balanced such permutation tests characterize tests with maximum power against all alternative hypotheses as observed by rosenbaum the anova ftest of the nullhypothesis that all treatments have exactly the same effect is recommended as a practical test because of its robustness against many alternative distributions extended logic anova consists of separable parts partitioning sources of variance and hypothesis testing can be used individually anova is used to support other statistical tools regression is first used to fit more complex models to data then anova is used to compare models with the objective of selecting simpler models that adequately describe the data such models could be fit without any reference to anova but anova tools could then be used to make some sense of the fitted models and to test hypotheses about batches of coefficients we think of the analysis of variance as a way of understanding and structuring multilevel modelsnot as an alternative to regression but as a tool for summarizing complex highdimensional inferences
43,there are several types of anova many statisticians base anova on the design of the experiment especially on the protocol that specifies the random assignment of treatments to subjects the protocols description of the assignment mechanism should include a specification of the structure of the treatments and of any blocking it is also common to apply anova to observational data using an appropriate statistical model some popular designs use the following types of anova oneway anova is used to test for differences among two or more independent groups meanseg different levels of urea application in a crop or different levels of antibiotic action on several bacterial species or different levels of effect of some medicine on groups of patients typically however the oneway anova is used to test for differences among at least three groups since the twogroup case can be covered by a ttest when there are only two means to compare the ttest and the anova ftest are equivalent the relation between anova and t is given by f t2 factorial anova is used when the experimenter wants to study the interaction effects among the treatments repeated measures anova is used when the same subjects are used for each treatment eg in a longitudinal study multivariate analysis of variance manova is used when there is more than one response variable

43,anova is considered to be a special case of linear regression which in turn is a special case of the general linear model all consider the observations to be the sum of a model fit and a residual error to be minimized the kruskalwallis test and the friedman test are nonparametric tests which do not rely on an assumption of normality connection to linear regression below we make clear the connection between multiway anova and linear regression linearly reorder the data so that observation is associated with a response and factors where denotes the different factors and is the total number of factors in oneway anova and in twoway anova furthermore we assume the factor has levels now we can onehot encode the factors into the dimensional vector the onehot encoding function is defined such that the entry of is the vector is the concatenation of all of the above vectors for all thus in order to obtain a fully general way interaction anova we must also concatenate every additional interaction term in the vector and then add an intercept term let that vector be with this notation in place we now have the exact connection with linear regression we simply regress response against the vector however there is a concern about identifiability in order to overcome such issues we assume that the sum of the parameters within each set of interactions is equal to zero from here one can use fstatistics or other methods to determine the relevance of the individual factors example we can consider the 2way interaction example where we assume that the first factor has 2 levels and the second factor has 3 levels define if and if ie is the onehot encoding of the first factor and is the onehot encoding of the second factor with that where the last term is an intercept term for a more concrete example suppose that then
43,balanced experiments those with an equal sample size for each treatment are relatively easy to interpret unbalanced experiments offer more complexity for single factor one way anova the adjustment for unbalanced data is easy but the unbalanced analysis lacks both robustness and power for more complex designs the lack of balance leads to further complications the orthogonality property of main effects and interactions present in balanced data does not carry over to the unbalanced case this means that the usual analysis of variance techniques do not apply consequently the analysis of unbalanced factorials is much more difficult than that for balanced designs in the general case the analysis of variance can also be applied to unbalanced data but then the sums of squares mean squares and fratios will depend on the order in which the sources of variation are considered the simplest techniques for handling unbalanced data restore balance by either throwing out data or by synthesizing missing data more complex techniques use regression anova is in part a significance test the american psychological association holds the view that simply reporting significance is insufficient and that reporting confidence bounds is preferred while anova is conservative in maintaining a significance level against multiple comparisons in one dimension it is not conservative against comparisons in multiple dimensions
43,the analysis of variance has been studied from several approaches the most common of which uses a linear model that relates the response to the treatments and blocks note that the model is linear in parameters but may be nonlinear across factor levels interpretation is easy when data is balanced across factors but much deeper understanding is needed for unbalanced data textbook analysis using a normal distribution the analysis of variance can be presented in terms of a linear model which makes the following assumptions about the probability distribution of the responses independence of observations this is an assumption of the model that simplifies the statistical analysis normality the distributions of the residuals are normal equality or homogeneity of variances called homoscedasticity the variance of data in groups should be the same the separate assumptions of the textbook model imply that the errors are independently identically and normally distributed for fixed effects models that is that the errors are independent and randomizationbased analysis in a randomized controlled experiment the treatments are randomly assigned to experimental units following the experimental protocol this randomization is objective and declared before the experiment is carried out the objective randomassignment is used to test the significance of the null hypothesis following the ideas of c s peirce and ronald fisher this designbased analysis was discussed and developed by francis j anscombe at rothamsted experimental station and by oscar kempthorne at iowa state university kempthorne and his students make an assumption of unit treatment additivity which is discussed in the books of kempthorne and david r cox unittreatment additivity in its simplest form the assumption of unittreatment additivity states that the observed response from experimental unit when receiving treatment can be written as the sum of the units response and the treatmenteffect that is the assumption of unittreatment additivity implies that for every treatment the th treatment has exactly the same effect on every experiment unit the assumption of unit treatment additivity usually cannot be directly falsified according to cox and kempthorne however many consequences of treatmentunit additivity can be falsified for a randomized experiment the assumption of unittreatment additivity implies that the variance is constant for all treatments therefore by contraposition a necessary condition for unittreatment additivity is that the variance is constant the use of unit treatment additivity and randomization is similar to the designbased inference that is standard in finitepopulation survey sampling derived linear model kempthorne uses the randomizationdistribution and the assumption of unit treatment additivity to produce a derived linear model very similar to the textbook model discussed previously the test statistics of this derived linear model are closely approximated by the test statistics of an appropriate normal linear model according to approximation theorems and simulation studies however there are differences for example the randomizationbased analysis results in a small but strictly negative correlation between the observations in the randomizationbased analysis there is no assumption of a normal distribution and certainly no assumption of independence on the contrary the observations are dependent the randomizationbased analysis has the disadvantage that its exposition involves tedious algebra and extensive time since the randomizationbased analysis is complicated and is closely approximated by the approach using a normal linear model most teachers emphasize the normal linear model approach few statisticians object to modelbased analysis of balanced randomized experiments statistical models for observational data however when applied to data from nonrandomized experiments or observational studies modelbased analysis lacks the warrant of randomization for observational data the derivation of confidence intervals must use subjective models as emphasized by ronald fisher and his followers in practice the estimates of treatmenteffects from observational studies generally are often inconsistent in practice statistical models and observational data are useful for suggesting hypotheses that should be treated very cautiously by the public summary of assumptions the normalmodel based anova analysis assumes the independence normality and homogeneity of the variances of the residuals the randomizationbased analysis assumes only the homogeneity of the variances of the residuals as a consequence of unittreatment additivity and uses the randomization procedure of the experiment both these analyses require homoscedasticity as an assumption for the normalmodel analysis and as a consequence of randomization and additivity for the randomizationbased analysis however studies of processes that change variances rather than means called dispersion effects have been successfully conducted using anova there are no necessary assumptions for anova in its full generality but the ftest used for anova hypothesis testing has assumptions and practical limitations which are of continuing interest problems which do not satisfy the assumptions of anova can often be transformed to satisfy the assumptions the property of unittreatment additivity is not invariant under a change of scale so statisticians often use transformations to achieve unittreatment additivity if the response variable is expected to follow a parametric family of probability distributions then the statistician may specify in the protocol for the experiment or observational study that the responses be transformed to stabilize the variance also a statistician may specify that logarithmic transforms be applied to the responses which are believed to follow a multiplicative model according to cauchys functional equation theorem the logarithm is the only continuous transformation that transforms real multiplication to addition
43,no fitfair fitvery good fitthe analysis of variance can be used as an exploratory tool to explain observations a dog show provides an example a dog show is not a random sampling of the breed it is typically limited to dogs that are adult purebred and exemplary a histogram of dog weights from a show might plausibly be rather complex like the yelloworange distribution shown in the illustrations suppose we wanted to predict the weight of a dog based on a certain set of characteristics of each dog before we could do that we would need to explain the distribution of weights by dividing the dog population into groups based on those characteristics a successful grouping will split dogs such that a each group has a low variance of dog weights meaning the group is relatively homogeneous and b the mean of each group is distinct if two groups have the same mean then it isnt reasonable to conclude that the groups are in fact separate in any meaningful way in the illustrations to the right each group is identified as x1 x2 etc in the first illustration we divide the dogs according to the product interaction of two binary groupings young vs old and shorthaired vs longhaired thus group 1 is young shorthaired dogs group 2 is young longhaired dogs etc since the distributions of dog weight within each of the groups shown in blue has a large variance and since the means are very close across groups grouping dogs by these characteristics does not produce an effective way to explain the variation in dog weights knowing which group a dog is in does not allow us to make any reasonable statements as to what that dogs weight is likely to be thus this grouping fails to fit the distribution we are trying to explain yelloworange an attempt to explain the weight distribution by grouping dogs as pet vs working breed and less athletic vs more athletic would probably be somewhat more successful fair fit the heaviest show dogs are likely to be big strong working breeds while breeds kept as pets tend to be smaller and thus lighter as shown by the second illustration the distributions have variances that are considerably smaller than in the first case and the means are more reasonably distinguishable however the significant overlap of distributions for example means that we cannot reliably say that x1 and x2 are truly distinct ie it is perhaps reasonably likely that splitting dogs according to the flip of a coinby pure chancemight produce distributions that look similar an attempt to explain weight by breed is likely to produce a very good fit all chihuahuas are light and all st bernards are heavy the difference in weights between setters and pointers does not justify separate breeds the analysis of variance provides the formal tools to justify these intuitive judgments a common use of the method is the analysis of experimental data or the development of models the method has some advantages over correlation not all of the data must be numeric and one result of the method is a judgment in the confidence in an explanatory relationship

43,some analysis is required in support of the design of the experiment while other analysis is performed after changes in the factors are formally found to produce statistically significant changes in the responses because experimentation is iterative the results of one experiment alter plans for following experiments preparatory analysis the number of experimental units in the design of an experiment the number of experimental units is planned to satisfy the goals of the experiment experimentation is often sequential early experiments are often designed to provide meanunbiased estimates of treatment effects and of experimental error later experiments are often designed to test a hypothesis that a treatment effect has an important magnitude in this case the number of experimental units is chosen so that the experiment is within budget and has adequate power among other goals reporting sample size analysis is generally required in psychology provide information on sample size and the process that led to sample size decisions the analysis which is written in the experimental protocol before the experiment is conducted is examined in grant applications and administrative review boards besides the power analysis there are less formal methods for selecting the number of experimental units these include graphical methods based on limiting the probability of false negative errors graphical methods based on an expected variation increase above the residuals and methods based on achieving a desired confident interval power analysis power analysis is often applied in the context of anova in order to assess the probability of successfully rejecting the null hypothesis if we assume a certain anova design effect size in the population sample size and significance level power analysis can assist in study design by determining what sample size would be required in order to have a reasonable chance of rejecting the null hypothesis when the alternative hypothesis is true effect size several standardized measures of effect have been proposed for anova to summarize the strength of the association between a predictors and the dependent variable eg η2 ω2 or ƒ2 or the overall standardized difference ψ of the complete model standardized effectsize estimates facilitate comparison of findings across studies and disciplines however while standardized effect sizes are commonly used in much of the professional literature a nonstandardized measure of effect size that has immediately meaningful units may be preferable for reporting purposes followup analysis it is always appropriate to carefully consider outliers they have a disproportionate impact on statistical conclusions and are often the result of errors model confirmation it is prudent to verify that the assumptions of anova have been met residuals are examined or analyzed to confirm homoscedasticity and gross normality residuals should have the appearance of zero mean normal distribution noise when plotted as a function of anything including time and modeled data values trends hint at interactions among factors or among observations one rule of thumb if the largest standard deviation is less than twice the smallest standard deviation we can use methods based on the assumption of equal standard deviations and our results will still be approximately correct followup tests a statistically significant effect in anova is often followed up with one or more different followup tests this can be done in order to assess which groups are different from which other groups or to test various other focused hypotheses followup tests are often distinguished in terms of whether they are planned a priori or post hoc planned tests are determined before looking at the data and post hoc tests are performed after looking at the data often one of the treatments is none so the treatment group can act as a control dunnetts test a modification of the ttest tests whether each of the other treatment groups has the same mean as the control post hoc tests such as tukeys range test most commonly compare every group mean with every other group mean and typically incorporate some method of controlling for type i errors comparisons which are most commonly planned can be either simple or compound simple comparisons compare one group mean with one other group mean compound comparisons typically compare two sets of groups means where one set has two or more groups eg compare average group means of group a b and c with group d comparisons can also look at tests of trend such as linear and quadratic relationships when the independent variable involves ordered levels following anova with pairwise multiplecomparison tests has been criticized on several grounds there are many such tests 10 in one table and recommendations regarding their use are vague or conflicting
43,anova is a particular form of statistical hypothesis testing heavily used in the analysis of experimental data a test result calculated from the null hypothesis and the sample is called statistically significant if it is deemed unlikely to have occurred by chance assuming the truth of the null hypothesis a statistically significant result when a probability pvalue is less than a threshold significance level justifies the rejection of the null hypothesis but only if the priori probability of the null hypothesis is not high in the typical application of anova the null hypothesis is that all groups are simply random samples of the same population for example when studying the effect of different treatments on similar samples of patients the null hypothesis would be that all treatments have the same effect perhaps none rejecting the null hypothesis would imply that different treatments result in altered effects by construction hypothesis testing limits the rate of type i errors false positives to a significance level experimenters also wish to limit type ii errors false negatives the rate of type ii errors depends largely on sample size the rate will increase for small numbers of samples significance level when the standard of proof is high the chances of overlooking a discovery are also high and effect size a smaller effect size is more prone to type ii error the terminology of anova is largely from the statistical design of experiments the experimenter adjusts factors and measures responses in an attempt to determine an effect factors are assigned to experimental units by a combination of randomization and blocking to ensure the validity of the results blinding keeps the weighing impartial responses show a variability that is partially the result of the effect and is partially random error anova is the synthesis of several ideas and it is used for multiple purposes as a consequence it is difficult to define concisely or precisely classical anova for balanced data does three things at once in short anova is a statistical tool used in several ways to develop and confirm an explanation for the observed data additionally as a result anova has long enjoyed the status of being the most used some would say abused statistical technique in psychological research anova is probably the most useful technique in the field of statistical inference anova is difficult to teach particularly for complex experiments with splitplot designs being notorious in some cases the proper application of the method is best determined by problem pattern recognition followed by the consultation of a classic authoritative test designofexperiments terms condensed from the nist engineering statistics handbook section 57 a glossary of doe terminology balanced design an experimental design where all cells ie treatment combinations have the same number of observations blocking a schedule for conducting treatment combinations in an experimental study such that any effects on the experimental results due to a known change in raw materials operators machines etc become concentrated in the levels of the blocking variable the reason for blocking is to isolate a systematic effect and prevent it from obscuring the main effects blocking is achieved by restricting randomization design a set of experimental runs which allows the fit of a particular model and the estimate of effects doe design of experiments an approach to problem solving involving collection of data that will support valid defensible and supportable conclusions effect how changing the settings of a factor changes the response the effect of a single factor is also called a main effect error unexplained variation in a collection of observations does typically require understanding of both random error and lack of fit error experimental unit the entity to which a specific treatment combination is applied factors process inputs that an investigator manipulates to cause a change in the output lackoffit error error that occurs when the analysis omits one or more important terms or factors from the process model including replication in a doe allows separation of experimental error into its components lack of fit and random pure error model mathematical relationship which relates changes in a given response to changes in one or more factors random error error that occurs due to natural variation in the process random error is typically assumed to be normally distributed with zero mean and a constant variance random error is also called experimental error randomization a schedule for allocating treatment material and for conducting treatment combinations in a doe such that the conditions in one run neither depend on the conditions of the previous run nor predict the conditions in the subsequent runs replication performing the same treatment combination more than once including replication allows an estimate of the random error independent of any lack of fit error responses the outputs of a process sometimes called dependent variables treatment a treatment is a specific combination of factor levels whose effect is to be compared with other treatments
43,the simplest experiment suitable for anova analysis is the completely randomized experiment with a single factor more complex experiments with a single factor involve constraints on randomization and include completely randomized blocks and latin squares and variants graecolatin squares etc the more complex experiments share many of the complexities of multiple factors a relatively complete discussion of the analysis models data summaries anova table of the completely randomized experiment is available

43,anova generalizes to the study of the effects of multiple factors when the experiment includes observations at all combinations of levels of each factor it is termed factorial factorial experiments are more efficient than a series of single factor experiments and the efficiency grows as the number of factors increases consequently factorial designs are heavily used the use of anova to study the effects of multiple factors has a complication in a 3way anova with factors x y and z the anova model includes terms for the main effects x y z and terms for interactions xy xz yz xyz all terms require hypothesis tests the proliferation of interaction terms increases the risk that some hypothesis test will produce a false positive by chance fortunately experience says that high order interactions are rare the ability to detect interactions is a major advantage of multiple factor anova testing one factor at a time hides interactions but produces apparently inconsistent experimental results caution is advised when encountering interactions test interaction terms first and expand the analysis beyond anova if interactions are found texts vary in their recommendations regarding the continuation of the anova procedure after encountering an interaction interactions complicate the interpretation of experimental data neither the calculations of significance nor the estimated treatment effects can be taken at face value a significant interaction will often mask the significance of main effects graphical methods are recommended to enhance understanding regression is often useful a lengthy discussion of interactions is available in cox 1958 some interactions can be removed by transformations while others cannot a variety of techniques are used with multiple factor anova to reduce expense one technique used in factorial designs is to minimize replication possibly no replication with support of analytical trickery and to combine groups when effects are found to be statistically or practically insignificant an experiment with many insignificant factors may collapse into one with a few factors supported by many replications

43,there are three classes of models used in the analysis of variance and these are outlined here fixedeffects models the fixedeffects model class i of analysis of variance applies to situations in which the experimenter applies one or more treatments to the subjects of the experiment to see whether the response variable values change this allows the experimenter to estimate the ranges of response variable values that the treatment would generate in the population as a whole randomeffects models random effects model class ii is used when the treatments are not fixed this occurs when the various factor levels are sampled from a larger population because the levels themselves are random variables some assumptions and the method of contrasting the treatments a multivariable generalization of simple differences differ from the fixedeffects model mixedeffects models a mixedeffects model class iii contains experimental factors of both fixed and randomeffects types with appropriately different interpretations and analysis for the two types example teaching experiments could be performed by a college or university department to find a good introductory textbook with each text considered a treatment the fixedeffects model would compare a list of candidate texts the randomeffects model would determine whether important differences exist among a list of randomly selected texts the mixedeffects model would compare the fixed incumbent texts to randomly selected alternatives defining fixed and random effects has proven elusive with competing definitions arguably leading toward a linguistic quagmire

43,anova is used in the analysis of comparative experiments those in which only the difference in outcomes is of interest the statistical significance of the experiment is determined by a ratio of two variances this ratio is independent of several possible alterations to the experimental observations adding a constant to all observations does not alter significance multiplying all observations by a constant does not alter significance so anova statistical significance result is independent of constant bias and scaling errors as well as the units used in expressing observations in the era of mechanical calculation it was common to subtract a constant from all observations when equivalent to dropping leading digits to simplify data entry this is an example of data coding
43,while the analysis of variance reached fruition in the 20th century antecedents extend centuries into the past according to stigler these include hypothesis testing the partitioning of sums of squares experimental techniques and the additive model laplace was performing hypothesis testing in the 1770s the development of leastsquares methods by laplace and gauss circa 1800 provided an improved method of combining observations over the existing practices then used in astronomy and geodesy it also initiated much study of the contributions to sums of squares laplace soon knew how to estimate a variance from a residual rather than a total sum of squares by 1827 laplace was using least squares methods to address anova problems regarding measurements of atmospheric tides before 1800 astronomers had isolated observational errors resulting from reaction times the personal equation and had developed methods of reducing the errors the experimental methods used in the study of the personal equation were later accepted by the emerging field of psychology which developed strong full factorial experimental methods to which randomization and blinding were soon added an eloquent nonmathematical explanation of the additive effects model was available in 1885 ronald fisher introduced the term variance and proposed its formal analysis in a 1918 article the correlation between relatives on the supposition of mendelian inheritance his first application of the analysis of variance was published in 1921 analysis of variance became widely known after being included in fishers 1925 book statistical methods for research workers randomization models were developed by several researchers the first was published in polish by neyman in 1923 one of the attributes of anova which ensured its early popularity was computational elegance the structure of the additive model allows solution for the additive coefficients by simple algebra rather than by matrix calculations in the era of mechanical calculators this simplicity was critical the determination of statistical significance also required access to tables of the f function which were supplied by early statistics texts
43,analysis of variance anova is a collection of statistical models used to analyze the differences among group means and their associated procedures such as variation among and between groups developed by statistician and evolutionary biologist ronald fisher in the anova setting the observed variance in a particular variable is partitioned into components attributable to different sources of variation in its simplest form anova provides a statistical test of whether or not the means of several groups are equal and therefore generalizes the ttest to more than two groups anovas are useful for comparing testing three or more means groups or variables for statistical significance it is conceptually similar to multiple twosample ttests but is more conservative results in less type i error and is therefore suited to a wide range of practical problems
44,chemical structure of methane the simplest alkane in organic chemistry an alkane or paraffin a historical name that also has other meanings is an acyclic saturated hydrocarbon in other words an alkane consists of hydrogen and carbon atoms arranged in a tree structure in which all the carboncarbon bonds are single alkanes have the general chemical formula n2n2 the alkanes range in complexity from the simplest case of methane ch4 where n 1 sometimes called the parent molecule to arbitrarily large molecules besides this standard definition by the international union of pure and applied chemistry in some authors usage the term alkane is applied to any saturated hydrocarbon including those that are either monocyclic ie the cycloalkanes or polycyclic in an alkane each carbon atom has 4 bonds either cc or ch and each hydrogen atom is joined to one of the carbon atoms so in a ch bond the longest series of linked carbon atoms in a molecule is known as its carbon skeleton or carbon backbone the number of carbon atoms may be thought of as the size of the alkane one group of the higher alkanes are waxes solids at standard ambient temperature and pressure satp for which the number of carbons in the carbon backbone is greater than about 17 with their repeated ch2 units the alkanes constitute a homologous series of organic compounds in which the members differ in molecular mass by multiples of 1403 u the total mass of each such methylenebridge unit which comprises a single carbon atom of mass 1201 u and two hydrogen atoms of mass 101 u each alkanes are not very reactive and have little biological activity they can be viewed as molecular trees upon which can be hung the more activereactive functional groups of biological molecules the alkanes have two main commercial sources petroleum crude oil and natural gas an alkyl group generally abbreviated with the symbol r is a functional group that like an alkane consists solely of singlebonded carbon and hydrogen atoms connected acyclicallyfor example a methyl or ethyl group
44,petroleum refining an oil refinery at martinez california as stated earlier the most important source of alkanes is natural gas and crude oil alkanes are separated in an oil refinery by fractional distillation and processed into many different products fischertropsch the fischertropsch process is a method to synthesize liquid hydrocarbons including alkanes from carbon monoxide and hydrogen this method is used to produce substitutes for petroleum distillates laboratory preparation there is usually little need for alkanes to be synthesized in the laboratory since they are usually commercially available also alkanes are generally unreactive chemically or biologically and do not undergo functional group interconversions cleanly when alkanes are produced in the laboratory it is often a sideproduct of a reaction for example the use of nbutyllithium as a strong base gives the conjugate acid nbutane as a sideproduct c4h9li h2o c4h10 lioh however at times it may be desirable to make a section of a molecule into an alkanelike functionality alkyl group using the above or similar methods for example an ethyl group is an alkyl group when this is attached to a hydroxy group it gives ethanol which is not an alkane to do so the bestknown methods are hydrogenation of alkenes rchch2 h2 rch2ch3r alkyl alkanes or alkyl groups can also be prepared directly from alkyl halides in the coreyhouseposnerwhitesides reaction the bartonmccombie deoxygenation removes hydroxyl groups from alcohols eg bartonmccombie deoxygenation scheme and the clemmensen reduction removes carbonyl groups from aldehydes and ketones to form alkanes or alkylsubstituted compounds eg clemmensen reduction
44,the iupac nomenclature systematic way of naming compounds for alkanes is based on identifying hydrocarbon chains unbranched saturated hydrocarbon chains are named systematically with a greek numerical prefix denoting the number of carbons and the suffix ane in 1866 august wilhelm von hofmann suggested systematizing nomenclature by using the whole sequence of vowels a e i o and u to create suffixes ane ene ine or yne one une for the hydrocarbons cnh2n2 cnh2n cnh2n2 cnh2n4 cnh2n6 now the first three name hydrocarbons with single double and triple bonds one represents a ketone ol represents an alcohol or oh group oxy means an ether and refers to oxygen between two carbons so that methoxymethane is the iupac name for dimethyl ether it is difficult or impossible to find compounds with more than one iupac name this is because shorter chains attached to longer chains are prefixes and the convention includes brackets numbers in the name referring to which carbon a group is attached to should be as low as possible so that 1 is implied and usually omitted from names of organic compounds with only one sidegroup symmetric compounds will have two ways of arriving at the same name linear alkanes straightchain alkanes are sometimes indicated by the prefix n for normal where a nonlinear isomer exists although this is not strictly necessary the usage is still common in cases where there is an important difference in properties between the straightchain and branchedchain isomers eg nhexane or 2 or 3methylpentane alternative names for this group are linear paraffins or nparaffins the members of the series in terms of number of carbon atoms are named as follows methane ch4 one carbon and four hydrogen ethane c2h6 two carbon and six hydrogen propane c3h8 three carbon and 8 hydrogen butane c4h10 four carbon and 10 hydrogen pentane c5h12 five carbon and 12 hydrogen hexane c6h14 six carbon and 14 hydrogen the first four names were derived from methanol ether propionic acid and butyric acid respectively hexadecane is also sometimes referred to as cetane alkanes with five or more carbon atoms are named by adding the suffix ane to the appropriate numerical multiplier prefix with elision of any terminal vowel a or o from the basic numerical term hence pentane c5h12 hexane c6h14 heptane c7h16 octane c8h18 etc the prefix is generally greek however alkanes with a carbon atom count ending in nine for example nonane use the latin prefix non for a more complete list see list of alkanes branched alkanes ballandstick model of isopentane common name or 2methylbutane iupac systematic name simple branched alkanes often have a common name using a prefix to distinguish them from linear alkanes for example npentane isopentane and neopentane iupac naming conventions can be used to produce a systematic name the key steps in the naming of more complicated branched alkanes are as follows identify the longest continuous chain of carbon atoms name this longest root chain using standard naming rules name each side chain by changing the suffix of the name of the alkane from ane to yl number the root chain in order to give the lowest possible numbers for the sidechains number and name the side chains before the name of the root chain if there are multiple side chains of the same type use prefixes such as di and tri to indicate it as such and number each one add side chain names in alphabetical disregarding di etc prefixes order in front of the name of the root chain comparison of nomenclatures for three isomers of c5h12 common name npentane isopentane neopentane iupac name pentane 2methylbutane 22dimethylpropane structure 120px 90px 70px saturated cyclic hydrocarbons though technically distinct from the alkanes this class of hydrocarbons is referred to by some as the cyclic alkanes as their description implies they contain one or more rings simple cycloalkanes have a prefix cyclo to distinguish them from alkanes cycloalkanes are named as per their acyclic counterparts with respect to the number of carbon atoms in their backbones eg cyclopentane c5h10 is a cycloalkane with 5 carbon atoms just like pentane c5h12 but they are joined up in a fivemembered ring in a similar manner propane and cyclopropane butane and cyclobutane etc substituted cycloalkanes are named similarly to substituted alkanes the cycloalkane ring is stated and the substituents are according to their position on the ring with the numbering decided by the cahningoldprelog priority rules trivialcommon names the trivial nonsystematic name for alkanes is paraffins together alkanes are known as the paraffin series trivial names for compounds are usually historical artifacts they were coined before the development of systematic names and have been retained due to familiar usage in industry cycloalkanes are also called naphthenes it is almost certain that the term paraffin stems from the petrochemical industry branchedchain alkanes are called isoparaffins the use of the term paraffin is a general term and often does not distinguish between pure compounds and mixtures of isomers ie compounds of the same chemical formula eg pentane and isopentane examples the following trivial names are retained in the iupac system isobutane for 2methylpropane isopentane for 2methylbutane neopentane for 22dimethylpropane

in c alkanes experience intermolecular van der waals forces stronger intermolecular van der waals forces give rise to greater boiling points of alkanes there are two determinants for the strength of the van der waals forces the number of electrons surrounding the molecule which increases with the alkanes molecular weight the surface area of the molecule under standard conditions from ch4 to c4h10 alkanes are gaseous from c5h12 to c17h36 they are liquids and after c18h38 they are solids as the boiling point of alkanes is primarily determined by weight it should not be a surprise that the boiling point has almost a linear relationship with the size molecular weight of the molecule as a rule of thumb the boiling point rises 2030 c for each carbon added to the chain this rule applies to other homologous series a straightchain alkane will have a boiling point higher than a branchedchain alkane due to the greater surface area in contact thus the greater van der waals forces between adjacent molecules for example compare isobutane 2methylpropane and nbutane butane which boil at 12 and 0 c and 22dimethylbutane and 23dimethylbutane which boil at 50 and 58 c respectively for the latter case two molecules 23dimethylbutane can lock into each other better than the crossshaped 22dimethylbutane hence the greater van der waals forces on the other hand cycloalkanes tend to have higher boiling points than their linear counterparts due to the locked conformations of the molecules which give a plane of intermolecular contact melting points the melting points of the alkanes follow a similar trend to boiling points for the same reason as outlined above that is all other things being equal the larger the molecule the higher the melting point there is one significant difference between boiling points and melting points solids have more rigid and fixed structure than liquids this rigid structure requires energy to break down thus the better put together solid structures will require more energy to break apart for alkanes this can be seen from the graph above ie the blue line the oddnumbered alkanes have a lower trend in melting points than even numbered alkanes this is because even numbered alkanes pack well in the solid phase forming a wellorganized structure which requires more energy to break apart the oddnumbered alkanes pack less well and so the looser organized solid packing structure requires less energy to break apart the melting points of branchedchain alkanes can be either higher or lower than those of the corresponding straightchain alkanes again depending on the ability of the alkane in question to pack well in the solid phase this is particularly true for isoalkanes 2methyl isomers which often have melting points higher than those of the linear analogues conductivity and solubility alkanes do not conduct electricity nor are they substantially polarized by an electric field for this reason they do not form hydrogen bonds and are insoluble in polar solvents such as water since the hydrogen bonds between individual water molecules are aligned away from an alkane molecule the coexistence of an alkane and water leads to an increase in molecular order a reduction in entropy as there is no significant bonding between water molecules and alkane molecules the second law of thermodynamics suggests that this reduction in entropy should be minimized by minimizing the contact between alkane and water alkanes are said to be hydrophobic in that they repel water their solubility in nonpolar solvents is relatively good a property that is called lipophilicity different alkanes are for example miscible in all proportions among themselves the density of the alkanes usually increases with the number of carbon atoms but remains less than that of water hence alkanes form the upper layer in an alkanewater mixture molecular geometry sp3hybridization in methane the molecular structure of the alkanes directly affects their physical and chemical characteristics it is derived from the electron configuration of carbon which has four valence electrons the carbon atoms in alkanes are always sp3 hybridized that is to say that the valence electrons are said to be in four equivalent orbitals derived from the combination of the 2s orbital and the three 2p orbitals these orbitals which have identical energies are arranged spatially in the form of a tetrahedron the angle of cos1 10947 between them bond lengths and bond angles an alkane molecule has only ch and cc single bonds the former result from the overlap of an sp3 orbital of carbon with the 1s orbital of a hydrogen the latter by the overlap of two sp3 orbitals on different carbon atoms the bond lengths amount to 109 1010 m for a ch bond and 154 1010 m for a cc bond the tetrahedral structure of methane the spatial arrangement of the bonds is similar to that of the four sp3 orbitalsthey are tetrahedrally arranged with an angle of 10947 between them structural formulae that represent the bonds as being at right angles to one another while both common and useful do not correspond with the reality conformation the structural formula and the bond angles are not usually sufficient to completely describe the geometry of a molecule there is a further degree of freedom for each carboncarbon bond the torsion angle between the atoms or groups bound to the atoms at each end of the bond the spatial arrangement described by the torsion angles of the molecule is known as its conformation newman projections of the two conformations of ethane eclipsed on the left staggered on the right ballandstick models of the two rotamers of ethane ethane forms the simplest case for studying the conformation of alkanes as there is only one cc bond if one looks down the axis of the cc bond one will see the socalled newman projection the hydrogen atoms on both the front and rear carbon atoms have an angle of 120 between them resulting from the projection of the base of the tetrahedron onto a flat plane however the torsion angle between a given hydrogen atom attached to the front carbon and a given hydrogen atom attached to the rear carbon can vary freely between 0 and 360 this is a consequence of the free rotation about a carboncarbon single bond despite this apparent freedom only two limiting conformations are important eclipsed conformation and staggered conformation the two conformations also known as rotamers differ in energy the staggered conformation is 126 kjmol lower in energy more stable than the eclipsed conformation the least stable this difference in energy between the two conformations known as the torsion energy is low compared to the thermal energy of an ethane molecule at ambient temperature there is constant rotation about the cc bond the time taken for an ethane molecule to pass from one staggered conformation to the next equivalent to the rotation of one ch3 group by 120 relative to the other is of the order of 1011 seconds the case of higher alkanes is more complex but based on similar principles with the antiperiplanar conformation always being the most favored around each carboncarbon bond for this reason alkanes are usually shown in a zigzag arrangement in diagrams or in models the actual structure will always differ somewhat from these idealized forms as the differences in energy between the conformations are small compared to the thermal energy of the molecules alkane molecules have no fixed structural form whatever the models may suggest spectroscopic properties virtually all organic compounds contain carboncarbon and carbonhydrogen bonds and so show some of the features of alkanes in their spectra alkanes are notable for having no other groups and therefore for the absence of other characteristic spectroscopic features of a different functional group like oh cho cooh etc infrared spectroscopy the carbonhydrogen stretching mode gives a strong absorption between 2850 and 2960 cm1 while the carboncarbon stretching mode absorbs between 800 and 1300 cm1 the carbonhydrogen bending modes depend on the nature of the group methyl groups show bands at 1450 cm1 and 1375 cm1 while methylene groups show bands at 1465 cm1 and 1450 cm1 carbon chains with more than four carbon atoms show a weak absorption at around 725 cm1 nmr spectroscopy the proton resonances of alkanes are usually found at δh 0515 the carbon13 resonances depend on the number of hydrogen atoms attached to the carbon δc 830 primary methyl ch3 1555 secondary methylene ch2 2060 tertiary methyne ch and quaternary the carbon13 resonance of quaternary carbon atoms is characteristically weak due to the lack of nuclear overhauser effect and the long relaxation time and can be missed in weak samples or samples that have not been run for a sufficiently long time mass spectrometry alkanes have a high ionization energy and the molecular ion is usually weak the fragmentation pattern can be difficult to interpret but in the case of branched chain alkanes the carbon chain is preferentially cleaved at tertiary or quaternary carbons due to the relative stability of the resulting free radicals the fragment resulting from the loss of a single methyl group m 15 is often absent and other fragments are often spaced by intervals of fourteen mass units corresponding to sequential loss of ch2 groups
44,the applications of alkanes depend on the number of carbon atoms the first four alkanes are used mainly for heating and cooking purposes and in some countries for electricity generation methane and ethane are the main components of natural gas they are normally stored as gases under pressure it is however easier to transport them as liquids this requires both compression and cooling of the gas propane and butane are gases at atmospheric pressure that can be liquefied at fairly low pressures and are commonly known as liquified petroleum gas lpg propane is used in propane gas burners and as a fuel for road vehicles butane in space heaters and disposable cigarette lighters both are used as propellants in aerosol sprays from pentane to octane the alkanes are highly volatile liquids they are used as fuels in internal combustion engines as they vaporize easily on entry into the combustion chamber without forming droplets which would impair the uniformity of the combustion branchedchain alkanes are preferred as they are much less prone to premature ignition which causes knocking than their straightchain homologues this propensity to premature ignition is measured by the octane rating of the fuel where 224trimethylpentane isooctane has an arbitrary value of 100 and heptane has a value of zero apart from their use as fuels the middle alkanes are also good solvents for nonpolar substances alkanes from nonane to for instance hexadecane an alkane with sixteen carbon atoms are liquids of higher viscosity less and less suitable for use in gasoline they form instead the major part of diesel and aviation fuel diesel fuels are characterized by their cetane number cetane being an old name for hexadecane however the higher melting points of these alkanes can cause problems at low temperatures and in polar regions where the fuel becomes too thick to flow correctly alkanes from hexadecane upwards form the most important components of fuel oil and lubricating oil in the latter function they work at the same time as anticorrosive agents as their hydrophobic nature means that water cannot reach the metal surface many solid alkanes find use as paraffin wax for example in candles this should not be confused however with true wax which consists primarily of esters alkanes with a chain length of approximately 35 or more carbon atoms are found in bitumen used for example in road surfacing however the higher alkanes have little value and are usually split into lower alkanes by cracking some synthetic polymers such as polyethylene and polypropylene are alkanes with chains containing hundreds of thousands of carbon atoms these materials are used in innumerable applications and billions of kilograms of these materials are made and used each year
44,alkanes are chemically very inert apolar molecules which are not very reactive as organic compounds this inertness yields serious ecological issues if they are released into the environment due to their lack of functional groups and low water solubility alkanes show poor bioavailability for microorganisms there are however some microorganisms possessing the metabolic capacity to utilize nalkanes as both carbon and energy sources some bacterial species are highly specialised in degrading alkanes these are referred to as hydrocarbonoclastic bacteria
44,methane is explosive when mixed with air 18 ch4 and other lower alkanes can also form explosive mixtures with air the lighter liquid alkanes are highly flammable although this risk decreases with the length of the carbon chain pentane hexane heptane and octane are classed as dangerous for the environment and harmful considerations for detection or risk control methane is lighter than air possibility of accumulation under roofs ethane is slightly heavier than air possibility of pooling at ground level or in pits propane is heavier than air possibility of pooling at ground level or in pits butane is heavier than air possibility of pooling at ground level or in pits

44,saturated hydrocarbons are hydrocarbons having only single covalent bonds between their carbons they can be linear general formula wherein the carbon atoms are joined in a snakelike structure branched general formula n 2 wherein the carbon backbone splits off in one or more directions cyclic general formula n 3 wherein the carbon backbone is linked so as to form a loop according to the definition by iupac the former two are alkanes whereas the third group is called cycloalkanes saturated hydrocarbons can also combine any of the linear cyclic eg polycyclic and branching structures the general formula is where k is the number of independent loops alkanes are the acyclic loopless ones corresponding to k 0
44,alkene alkyne cycloalkane higher alkanes
44,alkanes are only weakly reactive with ionic and other polar substances the acid dissociation constant pka values of all alkanes are above 60 hence they are practically inert to acids and bases see carbon acids this inertness is the source of the term paraffins with the meaning here of lacking affinity in crude oil the alkane molecules have remained chemically unchanged for millions of years however redox reactions of alkanes in particular with oxygen and the halogens are possible as the carbon atoms are in a strongly reduced condition in the case of methane the lowest possible oxidation state for carbon 4 is reached reaction with oxygen if present in sufficient quantity to satisfy the reaction stoichiometry leads to combustion without any smoke producing carbon dioxide and water free radical halogenation reactions occur with halogens leading to the production of haloalkanes in addition alkanes have been shown to interact with and bind to certain transition metal complexes in ch bond activation free radicals molecules with unpaired electrons play a large role in most reactions of alkanes such as cracking and reformation where longchain alkanes are converted into shorterchain alkanes and straightchain alkanes into branchedchain isomers in highly branched alkanes the bond angle may differ significantly from the optimal value 1095 in order to allow the different groups sufficient space this causes a tension in the molecule known as steric hindrance and can substantially increase the reactivity reactions with oxygen combustion reaction all alkanes react with oxygen in a combustion reaction although they become increasingly difficult to ignite as the number of carbon atoms increases the general equation for complete combustion is cnh2n2 n o2 n 1 h2o n co2 or cnh2n2 o2 n 1 h2o n co2 in the absence of sufficient oxygen carbon monoxide or even soot can be formed as shown below cnh2n2 n o2 n 1 h2o n co cnh2n2 n o2 n 1 h2o n c for example methane 2 ch4 3 o2 2 co 4 h2o ch4 o2 co 2 h2o see the alkane heat of formation table for detailed data the standard enthalpy change of combustion δcho for alkanes increases by about 650 kjmol per ch2 group branchedchain alkanes have lower values of δcho than straightchain alkanes of the same number of carbon atoms and so can be seen to be somewhat more stable reactions with halogens alkanes react with halogens in a socalled free radical halogenation reaction the hydrogen atoms of the alkane are progressively replaced by halogen atoms free radicals are the reactive species that participate in the reaction which usually leads to a mixture of products the reaction is highly exothermic and can lead to an explosion these reactions are an important industrial route to halogenated hydrocarbons there are three steps initiation the halogen radicals form by homolysis usually energy in the form of heat or light is required chain reaction or propagation then takes placethe halogen radical abstracts a hydrogen from the alkane to give an alkyl radical this reacts further chain termination where the radicals recombine experiments have shown that all halogenation produces a mixture of all possible isomers indicating that all hydrogen atoms are susceptible to reaction the mixture produced however is not a statistical mixture secondary and tertiary hydrogen atoms are preferentially replaced due to the greater stability of secondary and tertiary freeradicals an example can be seen in the monobromination of propane monobromination of propane cracking cracking breaks larger molecules into smaller ones this can be done with a thermal or catalytic method the thermal cracking process follows a homolytic mechanism with formation of freeradicals the catalytic cracking process involves the presence of acid catalysts usually solid acids such as silicaalumina and zeolites which promote a heterolytic asymmetric breakage of bonds yielding pairs of ions of opposite charges usually a carbocation and the very unstable hydride anion carbonlocalized free radicals and cations are both highly unstable and undergo processes of chain rearrangement cc scission in position beta ie cracking and intra and intermolecular hydrogen transfer or hydride transfer in both types of processes the corresponding reactive intermediates radicals ions are permanently regenerated and thus they proceed by a selfpropagating chain mechanism the chain of reactions is eventually terminated by radical or ion recombination isomerization and reformation dragan and his colleague were the first to report about isomerization in alkanes isomerization and reformation are processes in which straightchain alkanes are heated in the presence of a platinum catalyst in isomerization the alkanes become branchedchain isomers in other words it does not lose any carbons or hydrogens keeping the same molecular weight in reformation the alkanes become cycloalkanes or aromatic hydrocarbons giving off hydrogen as a byproduct both of these processes raise the octane number of the substance butane is the most common alkane that is put under the process of isomerization as it makes many branched alkanes with high octane numbers other reactions alkanes will react with steam in the presence of a nickel catalyst to give hydrogen alkanes can be chlorosulfonated and nitrated although both reactions require special conditions the fermentation of alkanes to carboxylic acids is of some technical importance in the reed reaction sulfur dioxide chlorine and light convert hydrocarbons to sulfonyl chlorides nucleophilic abstraction can be used to separate an alkane from a metal alkyl groups can be transferred from one compound to another by transmetalation reactions
44,occurrence of alkanes in the universe methane and ethane make up a tiny proportion of jupiters atmosphere extraction of oil which contains many different hydrocarbons including alkanes alkanes form a small portion of the atmospheres of the outer gas planets such as jupiter 01 methane 2 ppm ethane saturn 02 methane 5 ppm ethane uranus 199 methane 25 ppm ethane and neptune 15 methane 15 ppm ethane titan 16 methane a satellite of saturn was examined by the huygens probe which indicated that titans atmosphere periodically rains liquid methane onto the moons surface also on titan the cassini mission has imaged seasonal methaneethane lakes near the polar regions of titan methane and ethane have also been detected in the tail of the comet hyakutake chemical analysis showed that the abundances of ethane and methane were roughly equal which is thought to imply that its ices formed in interstellar space away from the sun which would have evaporated these volatile molecules alkanes have also been detected in meteorites such as carbonaceous chondrites occurrence of alkanes on earth traces of methane gas about 00002 or 1745 ppb occur in the earths atmosphere produced primarily by methanogenic microorganisms such as archaea in the gut of ruminants the most important commercial sources for alkanes are natural gas and oil natural gas contains primarily methane and ethane with some propane and butane oil is a mixture of liquid alkanes and other hydrocarbons these hydrocarbons were formed when marine animals and plants zooplankton and phytoplankton died and sank to the bottom of ancient seas and were covered with sediments in an anoxic environment and converted over many millions of years at high temperatures and high pressure to their current form natural gas resulted thereby for example from the following reaction c6h12o6 3 ch4 3 co2 these hydrocarbon deposits collected in porous rocks trapped beneath impermeable cap rocks comprise commercial oil fields they have formed over millions of years and once exhausted cannot be readily replaced the depletion of these hydrocarbons reserves is the basis for what is known as the energy crisis methane is also present in what is called biogas produced by animals and decaying matter which is a possible renewable energy source alkanes have a low solubility in water so the content in the oceans is negligible however at high pressures and low temperatures such as at the bottom of the oceans methane can cocrystallize with water to form a solid methane clathrate methane hydrate although this cannot be commercially exploited at the present time the amount of combustible energy of the known methane clathrate fields exceeds the energy content of all the natural gas and oil deposits put together methane extracted from methane clathrate is therefore a candidate for future fuels biological occurrence acyclic alkanes occur in nature in various ways bacteria and archaea methanogenic archaea in the gut of this cow are responsible for some of the methane in earths atmosphere certain types of bacteria can metabolize alkanes they prefer evennumbered carbon chains as they are easier to degrade than oddnumbered chains on the other hand certain archaea the methanogens produce large quantities of methane by the metabolism of carbon dioxide or other oxidized organic compounds the energy is released by the oxidation of hydrogen co2 4 h2 ch4 2 h2o methanogens are also the producers of marsh gas in wetlands and release about two billion tonnes of methane per yearthe atmospheric content of this gas is produced nearly exclusively by them the methane output of cattle and other herbivores which can release up to 150 liters per day and of termites is also due to methanogens they also produce this simplest of all alkanes in the intestines of humans methanogenic archaea are hence at the end of the carbon cycle with carbon being released back into the atmosphere after having been fixed by photosynthesis it is probable that our current deposits of natural gas were formed in a similar way fungi and plants alkanes also play a role if a minor role in the biology of the three eukaryotic groups of organisms fungi plants and animals some specialized yeasts eg candida tropicale pichia sp rhodotorula sp can use alkanes as a source of carbon or energy the fungus amorphotheca resinae prefers the longerchain alkanes in aviation fuel and can cause serious problems for aircraft in tropical regions in plants the solid longchain alkanes are found in the plant cuticle and epicuticular wax of many species but are only rarely major constituents they protect the plant against water loss prevent the leaching of important minerals by the rain and protect against bacteria fungi and harmful insects the carbon chains in plant alkanes are usually oddnumbered between 27 and 33 carbon atoms in length and are made by the plants by decarboxylation of evennumbered fatty acids the exact composition of the layer of wax is not only speciesdependent but changes also with the season and such environmental factors as lighting conditions temperature or humidity more volatile shortchain alkanes are also produced by and found in plant tissues the jeffrey pine is noted for producing exceptionally high levels of nheptane in its resin for which reason its distillate was designated as the zero point for one octane rating floral scents have also long been known to contain volatile alkane components and nnonane is a significant component in the scent of some roses emission of gaseous and volatile alkanes such as ethane pentane and hexane by plants has also been documented at low levels though they are not generally considered to be a major component of biogenic air pollution edible vegetable oils also typically contain small fractions of biogenic alkanes with a wide spectrum of carbon numbers mainly 8 to 35 usually peaking in the low to upper 20s with concentrations up to dozens of milligrams per kilogram parts per million by weight and sometimes over a hundred for the total alkane fraction animals alkanes are found in animal products although they are less important than unsaturated hydrocarbons one example is the shark liver oil which is approximately 14 pristane 261014tetramethylpentadecane c19h40 they are important as pheromones chemical messenger materials on which insects depend for communication in some species eg the support beetle xylotrechus colonus pentacosane c25h52 3methylpentaicosane c26h54 and 9methylpentaicosane c26h54 are transferred by body contact with others like the tsetse fly glossina morsitans morsitans the pheromone contains the four alkanes 2methylheptadecane c18h38 1721dimethylheptatriacontane c39h80 1519dimethylheptatriacontane c39h80 and 151923trimethylheptatriacontane c40h82 and acts by smell over longer distances waggledancing honey bees produce and release two alkanes tricosane and pentacosane ecological relations early spider orchid ophrys sphegodes one example in which both plant and animal alkanes play a role is the ecological relationship between the sand bee andrena nigroaenea and the early spider orchid ophrys sphegodes the latter is dependent for pollination on the former sand bees use pheromones in order to identify a mate in the case of a nigroaenea the females emit a mixture of tricosane c23h48 pentacosane c25h52 and heptacosane c27h56 in the ratio 331 and males are attracted by specifically this odor the orchid takes advantage of this mating arrangement to get the male bee to collect and disseminate its pollen parts of its flower not only resemble the appearance of sand bees but also produce large quantities of the three alkanes in the same ratio as female sand bees as a result numerous males are lured to the blooms and attempt to copulate with their imaginary partner although this endeavor is not crowned with success for the bee it allows the orchid to transfer its pollen which will be dispersed after the departure of the frustrated male to different blooms

45,the result of an appeal can be affirmed where the reviewing court basically agrees with the result of the lower courts rulings reversed where the reviewing court basically disagrees with the result of the lower courts rulings and overturns their decision remanded where the reviewing court sends the case back to the lower court there can be multiple outcomes so that the reviewing court can affirm some rulings reverse others and remand the case all at the same time remand is not required where there is nothing left to do in the case generally speaking an appellate courts judgment provides the final directive of the appeals courts as to the matter appealed setting out with specificity the courts determination that the action appealed from should be affirmed reversed remanded or modified some reviewing courts who have discretionary review may send a case back without comment other than review improvidently granted in other words after looking at the case they chose not to say anything the result for the case of review improvidently granted is effectively the same as affirmed but without that extra higher court stamp of approval
45,many jurisdictions recognize two types of appeals particularly in the criminal context the first is the traditional direct appeal in which the appellant files an appeal with the next higher court of review the second is the collateral appeal or postconviction petition in which the petitionerappellant files the appeal in a court of first instanceusually the court that tried the case the key distinguishing factor between direct and collateral appeals is that the former occurs in state courts and the latter in federal courts relief in postconviction is rare and is most often found in capital or violent felony cases the typical scenario involves an incarcerated defendant locating dna evidence demonstrating the defendants actual innocence appellate review appellate review is the general term for the process by which courts with appellate jurisdiction take jurisdiction of matters decided by lower courts it is distinguished from judicial review which refers to the courts overriding constitutional or statutory right to determine if a legislative act or administrative decision is defective for jurisdictional or other reasons which may vary by jurisdiction in most jurisdictions the normal and preferred way of seeking appellate review is by filing an appeal of the final judgment generally an appeal of the judgment will also allow appeal of all other orders or rulings made by the trial court in the course of the case this is because such orders cannot be appealed as of right however certain critical interlocutory court orders such as the denial of a request for an interim injunction or an order holding a person in contempt of court can be appealed immediately although the case may otherwise not have been fully disposed of there are two distinct forms of appellate review direct and collateral for example a criminal defendant may be convicted in state court and lose on direct appeal to higher state appellate courts and if unsuccessful mount a collateral action such as filing for a writ of habeas corpus in the federal courts generally speaking direct appeal statutes afford defendants the opportunity to challenge the merits of a judgment and allege errors of law or fact collateral review on the other hand provides an independent and civil inquiry into the validity of a conviction and sentence and as such are generally limited to challenges to constitutional jurisdictional or other fundamental violations that occurred at trial graham v borgen 483 f 3d 475 7th cir 2007 no 044103 slip op at 7 citation omitted in angloamerican common law courts appellate review of lower court decisions may also be obtained by filing a petition for review by prerogative writ in certain cases there is no corresponding right to a writ in any pure or continental civil law legal systems though some mixed systems such as quebec recognize these prerogative writs direct appeal after exhausting the first appeal as of right defendants usually petition the highest state court to review the decision this appeal is known as a direct appeal the highest state court generally known as the supreme court exercises discretion over whether it will review the case on direct appeal a prisoner challenges the grounds of the conviction based on an error that occurred at trial or some other stage in the adjudicative process preservation issues an appellants claims must usually be preserved at trial this means that the defendant had to object to the error when it occurred in the trial because constitutional claims are of great magnitude appellate courts might be more lenient to review the claim even if it was not preserved for example connecticut applies the following standard to review unpreserved claims 1the record is adequate to review the alleged claim of error 2 the claim is of constitutional magnitude alleging the violation of a fundamental right 3 the alleged constitutional violation clearly exists and clearly deprived the defendant of a fair trial 4 if subject to harmless error analysis the state has failed to demonstrate harmlessness of the alleged constitutional violation beyond a reasonable doubt state post conviction relief collateral appeal all states have a postconviction relief process similar to federal postconviction relief an appellant can petition the court to correct alleged fundamental errors that were not corrected on direct review typical claims might include ineffective assistance of counsel and actual innocence based on new evidence these proceedings are normally separate from the direct appeal however some states allow for collateral relief to be sought on direct appeal after direct appeal the conviction is considered final an appeal from the post conviction court proceeds just as a direct appeal that is it goes to the intermediate appellate court followed by the highest court if the petition is granted the appellant could be released from incarceration the sentence could be modified or a new trial could be ordered habeas corpus

45,generally speaking the appellate court examines the record of evidence presented in the trial court and the law that the lower court applied and decides whether that decision was legally sound or not the appellate court will typically be deferential to the lower courts findings of fact such as whether a defendant committed a particular act unless clearly erroneous and so will focus on the courts application of the law to those facts such as whether the act found by the court to have occurred fits a legal definition at issue if the appellate court finds no defect it affirms the judgment if the appellate court does find a legal defect in the decision below ie in the lower court it may modify the ruling to correct the defect or it may nullify reverse or vacate the whole decision or any part of it it may in addition send the case back remand or remit to the lower court for further proceedings to remedy the defect in some cases an appellate court may review a lower court decision de novo or completely challenging even the lower courts findings of fact this might be the proper standard of review for example if the lower court resolved the case by granting a pretrial motion to dismiss or motion for summary judgment which is usually based only upon written submissions to the trial court and not on any trial testimony another situation is where appeal is by way of rehearing certain jurisdictions permit certain appeals to cause the trial to be heard afresh in the appellate court sometimes the appellate court finds a defect in the procedure the parties used in filing the appeal and dismisses the appeal without considering its merits which has the same effect as affirming the judgment below this would happen for example if the appellant waited too long under the appellate courts rules to file the appeal generally there is no trial in an appellate court only consideration of the record of the evidence presented to the trial court and all the pretrial and trial court proceedings are reviewedunless the appeal is by way of rehearing new evidence will usually only be considered on appeal in very rare instances for example if that material evidence was unavailable to a party for some very significant reason such as prosecutorial misconduct in some systems an appellate court will only consider the written decision of the lower court together with any written evidence that was before that court and is relevant to the appeal in other systems the appellate court will normally consider the record of the lower court in those cases the record will first be certified by the lower court the appellant has the opportunity to present arguments for the granting of the appeal and the appellee or respondent can present arguments against it arguments of the parties to the appeal are presented through their appellate lawyers if represented or pro se if the party has not engaged legal representation those arguments are presented in written briefs and sometimes in oral argument to the court at a hearing at such hearings each party is allowed a brief presentation at which the appellate judges ask questions based on their review of the record below and the submitted briefs in an adversarial system appellate courts do not have the power to review lower court decisions unless a party appeals it therefore if a lower court has ruled in an improper manner or against legal precedent that judgment will stand if not appealed even if it might have been overturned on appeal the united states legal system generally recognizes two types of appeals a trial de novo or an appeal on the record a trial de novo is usually available for review of informal proceedings conducted by some minor judicial tribunals in proceedings that do not provide all the procedural attributes of a formal judicial trial if unchallenged these decisions have the power to settle more minor legal disputes once and for all if a party is dissatisfied with the finding of such a tribunal one generally has the power to request a trial de novo by a court of record in such a proceeding all issues and evidence may be developed newly as though never heard before and one is not restricted to the evidence heard in the lower proceeding sometimes however the decision of the lower proceeding is itself admissible as evidence thus helping to curb frivolous appeals in some cases an application for trial de novo effectively erases the prior trial as if it had never taken place the supreme court of virginia has stated that this court has repeatedly held that the effect of an appeal to circuit court is to annul the judgment of the inferior tribunal as completely as if there had been no previous trial the only exception to this is that if a defendant appeals a conviction for a crime having multiple levels of offenses where they are convicted on a lesser offense the appeal is of the lesser offense the conviction represents an acquittal of the more serious offenses a trial on the same charges in the circuit court does not violate double jeopardy principles subject only to the limitation that conviction in the district court for an offense lesser included in the one charged constitutes an acquittal of the greater offense permitting trial de novo in the circuit court only for the lesserincluded offense in an appeal on the record from a decision in a judicial proceeding both appellant and respondent are bound to base their arguments wholly on the proceedings and body of evidence as they were presented in the lower tribunal each seeks to prove to the higher court that the result they desired was the just result precedent and case law figure prominently in the arguments in order for the appeal to succeed the appellant must prove that the lower court committed reversible error that is an impermissible action by the court acted to cause a result that was unjust and which would not have resulted had the court acted properly some examples of reversible error would be erroneously instructing the jury on the law applicable to the case permitting seriously improper argument by an attorney admitting or excluding evidence improperly acting outside the courts jurisdiction injecting bias into the proceeding or appearing to do so juror misconduct etc the failure to formally object at the time to what one views as improper action in the lower court may result in the affirmance of the lower courts judgment on the grounds that one did not preserve the issue for appeal by objecting in cases where a judge rather than a jury decided issues of fact an appellate court will apply an abuse of discretion standard of review under this standard the appellate court gives deference to the lower courts view of the evidence and reverses its decision only if it were a clear abuse of discretion this is usually defined as a decision outside the bounds of reasonableness on the other hand the appellate court normally gives less deference to a lower courts decision on issues of law and may reverse if it finds that the lower court applied the wrong legal standard in some cases an appellant may successfully argue that the law under which the lower decision was rendered was unconstitutional or otherwise invalid or may convince the higher court to order a new trial on the basis that evidence earlier sought was concealed or only recently discovered in the case of new evidence there must be a high probability that its presence or absence would have made a material difference in the trial another issue suitable for appeal in criminal cases is effective assistance of counsel if a defendant has been convicted and can prove that his lawyer did not adequately handle his case and that there is a reasonable probability that the result of the trial would have been different had the lawyer given competent representation he is entitled to a new trial a lawyer traditionally starts an oral argument to any appellate court with the words may it please the court after an appeal is heard the mandate is a formal notice of a decision by a court of appeal this notice is transmitted to the trial court and when filed by the clerk of the trial court constitutes the final judgment on the case unless the appeal court has directed further proceedings in the trial court the mandate is distinguished from the appeal courts opinion which sets out the legal reasoning for its decision in some jurisdictions the mandate is known as the remittitur

51,early 20th century abacus used in danish elementary school a twenty bead rekenrek around the world abaci have been used in preschools and elementary schools as an aid in teaching the numeral system and arithmetic in western countries a bead frame similar to the russian abacus but with straight wires and a vertical frame has been common see image it is still often seen as a plastic or wooden toy the wire frame may be used either with positional notation like other abaci thus the 10wire version may represent numbers up to 9999999999 or each bead may represent one unit so that eg 74 can be represented by shifting all beads on 7 wires and 4 beads on the 8th wire so numbers up to 100 may be represented in the bead frame shown the gap between the 5th and 6th wire corresponding to the color change between the 5th and the 6th bead on each wire suggests the latter use the redandwhite abacus is used in contemporary primary schools for a wide range of numberrelated lessons the twenty bead version referred to by its dutch name rekenrek calculating frame is often used sometimes on a string of beads sometimes on a rigid framework
51,the use of the word abacus dates before 1387 ad when a middle english work borrowed the word from latin to describe a sandboard abacus the latin word came from greek ἄβαξ abax which means something without base and improperly any piece of rectangular board or plank alternatively without reference to ancient texts on etymology it has been suggested that it means a square tablet strewn with dust or drawingboard covered with dust for the use of mathematics the exact shape of the latin perhaps reflects the genitive form of the greek word ἄβακoς abakos whereas the table strewn with dust definition is popular there are those that do not place credence in this at all and in fact state that it is not proven greek ἄβαξ itself is probably a borrowing of a northwest semitic perhaps phoenician word akin to hebrew ʾābāq אבק dust or in postbiblical sense meaning sand used as a writing surface the preferred plural of abacus is a subject of disagreement with both abacuses and abaci in use the user of an abacus is called an abacist
51,mesopotamian the period 27002300 bc saw the first appearance of the sumerian abacus a table of successive columns which delimited the successive orders of magnitude of their sexagesimal number system some scholars point to a character from the babylonian cuneiform which may have been derived from a representation of the abacus it is the belief of old babylonian scholars such as carruccio that old babylonians may have used the abacus for the operations of addition and subtraction however this primitive device proved difficult to use for more complex calculations egyptian the use of the abacus in ancient egypt is mentioned by the greek historian herodotus who writes that the egyptians manipulated the pebbles from right to left opposite in direction to the greek lefttoright method archaeologists have found ancient disks of various sizes that are thought to have been used as counters however wall depictions of this instrument have not been discovered persian during the achaemenid empire around 600 bc the persians first began to use the abacus under the parthian sassanian and iranian empires scholars concentrated on exchanging knowledge and inventions with the countries around them india china and the roman empire when it is thought to have been exported to other countries greek an early photograph of the salamis tablet 1899 the original is marble and is held by the national museum of epigraphy in athens the earliest archaeological evidence for the use of the greek abacus dates to the 5th century bc also demosthenes 384 bc322 bc talked of the need to use pebbles for calculations too difficult for your head a play by alexis from the 4th century bc mentions an abacus and pebbles for accounting and both diogenes and polybius mention men that sometimes stood for more and sometimes for less like the pebbles on an abacus the greek abacus was a table of wood or marble preset with small counters in wood or metal for mathematical calculations this greek abacus saw use in achaemenid persia the etruscan civilization ancient rome and until the french revolution the western christian world a tablet found on the greek island salamis in 1846 ad the salamis tablet dates back to 300 bc making it the oldest counting board discovered so far it is a slab of white marble long wide and thick on which are 5 groups of markings in the center of the tablet is a set of 5 parallel lines equally divided by a vertical line capped with a semicircle at the intersection of the bottommost horizontal line and the single vertical line below these lines is a wide space with a horizontal crack dividing it below this crack is another group of eleven parallel lines again divided into two sections by a line perpendicular to them but with the semicircle at the top of the intersection the third sixth and ninth of these lines are marked with a cross where they intersect with the vertical line also from this time frame the darius vase was unearthed in 1851 it was covered with pictures including a treasurer holding a wax tablet in one hand while manipulating counters on a table with the other chinese suanpan the number represented in the picture is 6302715408 the earliest known written documentation of the chinese abacus dates to the 2nd century bc the chinese abacus known as the suanpan 算盤 lit counting tray mandarin suàn pán cantonese syun3 pun4 is typically tall and comes in various widths depending on the operator it usually has more than seven rods there are two beads on each rod in the upper deck and five beads each in the bottom the beads are usually rounded and made of a hardwood the beads are counted by moving them up or down towards the beam if you move them toward the beam you count their value if you move away you dont count their value the suanpan can be reset to the starting position instantly by a quick movement along the horizontal axis to spin all the beads away from the horizontal beam at the center suanpans can be used for functions other than counting unlike the simple counting board used in elementary schools very efficient suanpan techniques have been developed to do multiplication division addition subtraction square root and cube root operations at high speed there are currently schools teaching students how to use it in the long scroll along the river during the qingming festival painted by zhang zeduan 10851145 ad during the song dynasty 9601297 ad a suanpan is clearly seen lying beside an account book and doctors prescriptions on the counter of an apothecarys feibao the similarity of the roman abacus to the chinese one suggests that one could have inspired the other as there is some evidence of a trade relationship between the roman empire and china however no direct connection can be demonstrated and the similarity of the abaci may be coincidental both ultimately arising from counting with five fingers per hand where the roman model like most modern korean and japanese has 4 plus 1 bead per decimal place the standard suanpan has 5 plus 2 incidentally this allows use with a hexadecimal numeral system which was used for traditional chinese measures of weight instead of running on wires as in the chinese korean and japanese models the beads of roman model run in grooves presumably making arithmetic calculations much slower another possible source of the suanpan is chinese counting rods which operated with a decimal system but lacked the concept of zero as a place holder the zero was probably introduced to the chinese in the tang dynasty 618907 ad when travel in the indian ocean and the middle east would have provided direct contact with india allowing them to acquire the concept of zero and the decimal point from indian merchants and mathematicians roman copy of a roman abacus the normal method of calculation in ancient rome as in greece was by moving counters on a smooth table originally pebbles calculi were used later and in medieval europe jetons were manufactured marked lines indicated units fives tens etc as in the roman numeral system this system of counter casting continued into the late roman empire and in medieval europe and persisted in limited use into the nineteenth century due to pope sylvester iis reintroduction of the abacus with very useful modifications it became widely used in europe once again during the 11th century this abacus used beads on wires unlike the traditional roman counting boards which meant the abacus could be used much faster writing in the 1st century bc horace refers to the wax abacus a board covered with a thin layer of black wax on which columns and figures were inscribed using a stylus one example of archaeological evidence of the roman abacus shown here in reconstruction dates to the 1st century ad it has eight long grooves containing up to five beads in each and eight shorter grooves having either one or no beads in each the groove marked i indicates units x tens and so on up to millions the beads in the shorter grooves denote fives five units five tens etc essentially in a biquinary coded decimal system obviously related to the roman numerals the short grooves on the right may have been used for marking roman ounces ie fractions indian there is no clear evidence for use of the abacus in india the decimal number system invented in india replaced the abacus in western europe the abhidharmakośabhāṣya of vasubandhu 316396 a sanskrit work on buddhist philosophy says that the secondcentury ce philosopher vasumitra said that placing a wick sanskrit vartikā on the number one ekāṅka means it is a one while placing the wick on the number hundred means it is called a hundred and on the number one thousand means it is a thousand it is unclear exactly what this arrangement may have been around the 5th century indian clerks were already finding new ways of recording the contents of the abacus hindu texts used the term śūnya zero to indicate the empty column on the abacus japanese japanese soroban in japanese the abacus is called soroban lit counting tray imported from china in the 14th century it was probably in use by the working class a century or more before the ruling class started as the class structure did not allow for devices used by the lower class to be adopted or used by the ruling class the 14 abacus which is suited to decimal calculation appeared circa 1930 and became widespread as the japanese abandoned hexadecimal weight calculation which was still common in china the abacus is still manufactured in japan today even with the proliferation practicality and affordability of pocket electronic calculators the use of the soroban is still taught in japanese primary schools as part of mathematics primarily as an aid to faster mental calculation using visual imagery of a soroban one can arrive at the answer in the same time as or even faster than is possible with a physical instrument korean the chinese abacus migrated from china to korea around 1400 ad koreans call it jupan 주판 supan 수판 or jusan 주산 native american representation of an inca quipu a yupana as used by the incas some sources mention the use of an abacus called a

the account and tzintzin small similar elements its complete meaning was taken as counting with small similar elements by somebody its use was taught in the calmecac to the temalpouhqueh who were students dedicated to take the accounts of skies from childhood the nepōhualtzintzin was divided in two main parts separated by a bar or intermediate cord in the left part there were four beads which in the first row have unitary values 1 2 3 and 4 and in the right side there are three beads with values of 5 10 and 15 respectively in order to know the value of the respective beads of the upper rows it is enough to multiply by 20 by each row the value of the corresponding account in the first row altogether there were 13 rows with 7 beads in each one which made up 91 beads in each nepōhualtzintzin this was a basic number to understand 7 times 13 a close relation conceived between natural phenomena the underworld and the cycles of the heavens one nepōhualtzintzin 91 represented the number of days that a season of the year lasts two nepōhualtzitzin 182 is the number of days of the corns cycle from its sowing to its harvest three nepōhualtzintzin 273 is the number of days of a babys gestation and four nepōhualtzintzin 364 completed a cycle and approximate a year 1 days short when translated into modern computer arithmetic the nepōhualtzintzin amounted to the rank from 10 to the 18 in floating point which calculated stellar as well as infinitesimal amounts with absolute precision meant that no round off was allowed the rediscovery of the nepōhualtzintzin was due to the mexican engineer david esparza hidalgo who in his wanderings throughout mexico found diverse engravings and paintings of this instrument and reconstructed several of them made in gold jade encrustations of shell etc there have also been found very old nepōhualtzintzin attributed to the olmec culture and even some bracelets of mayan origin as well as a diversity of forms and materials in other cultures george i sanchez arithmetic in maya austintexas 1961 found another base 5 base 4 abacus in the yucatán peninsula that also computed calendar data this was a finger abacus on one hand 0 1 2 3 and 4 were used and on the other hand 0 1 2 and 3 were used note the use of zero at the beginning and end of the two cycles sanchez worked with sylvanus morley a noted mayanist the quipu of the incas was a system of colored knotted cords used to record numerical data like advanced tally sticks but not used to perform calculations calculations were carried out using a yupana quechua for counting tool see figure which was still in use after the conquest of peru the working principle of a yupana is unknown but in 2001 an explanation of the mathematical basis of these instruments was proposed by italian mathematician nicolino de pasquale by comparing the form of several yupanas researchers found that calculations were based using the fibonacci sequence 1 1 2 3 5 and powers of 10 20 and 40 as place values for the different fields in the instrument using the fibonacci sequence would keep the number of grains within any one field at a minimum russian russian abacus the russian abacus the schoty счёты usually has a single slanted deck with ten beads on each wire except one wire usually positioned near the user with four beads for quarterruble fractions older models have another 4bead wire for quarterkopeks which were minted until 1916 the russian abacus is often used vertically with wires from left to right in the manner of a book the wires are usually bowed to bulge upward in the center to keep the beads pinned to either of the two sides it is cleared when all the beads are moved to the right during manipulation beads are moved to the left for easy viewing the middle 2 beads on each wire the 5th and 6th bead usually are of a different color from the other eight beads likewise the left bead of the thousands wire and the million wire if present may have a different color as a simple cheap and reliable device the russian abacus was in use in all shops and markets throughout the former soviet union and the usage of it was taught in most schools until the 1990s even the 1874 invention of mechanical calculator odhner arithmometer had not replaced them in russia and likewise the mass production of felix arithmometers since 1924 did not significantly reduce their use in the soviet union the russian abacus began to lose popularity only after the mass production of microcalculators had started in the soviet union in 1974 today it is regarded as an archaism and replaced by the handheld calculator the russian abacus was brought to france around 1820 by the mathematician jeanvictor poncelet who served in napoleons army and had been a prisoner of war in russia the abacus had fallen out of use in western europe in the 16th century with the rise of decimal notation and algorismic methods to poncelets french contemporaries it was something new poncelet used it not for any applied purpose but as a teaching and demonstration aid the turks and the armenian people also used abaci similar to the russian schoty it was named a coulba by the turks and a choreb by the armenians

52,the strength of an acid refers to its ability or tendency to lose a proton a strong acid is one that completely dissociates in water in other words one mole of a strong acid ha dissolves in water yielding one mole of h and one mole of the conjugate base a and none of the protonated acid ha in contrast a weak acid only partially dissociates and at equilibrium both the acid and the conjugate base are in solution examples of strong acids are hydrochloric acid hcl hydroiodic acid hi hydrobromic acid hbr perchloric acid hclo4 nitric acid hno3 and sulfuric acid h2so4 in water each of these essentially ionizes 100 the stronger an acid is the more easily it loses a proton h two key factors that contribute to the ease of deprotonation are the polarity of the ha bond and the size of atom a which determines the strength of the ha bond acid strengths are also often discussed in terms of the stability of the conjugate base stronger acids have a larger ka and a more negative pka than weaker acids sulfonic acids which are organic oxyacids are a class of strong acids a common example is toluenesulfonic acid tosylic acid unlike sulfuric acid itself sulfonic acids can be solids in fact polystyrene functionalized into polystyrene sulfonate is a solid strongly acidic plastic that is filterable superacids are acids stronger than 100 sulfuric acid examples of superacids are fluoroantimonic acid magic acid and perchloric acid superacids can permanently protonate water to give ionic crystalline hydronium salts they can also quantitatively stabilize carbocations while ka measures the strength of an acid compound the strength of an aqueous acid solution is measured by ph which is an indication of the concentration of hydronium in the solution the ph of a simple solution of an acid compound in water is determined by the dilution of the compound and the compounds ka
52,modern definitions are concerned with the fundamental chemical reactions common to all acids most acids encountered in everyday life are aqueous solutions or can be dissolved in water so the arrhenius and brønstedlowry definitions are the most relevant the brønstedlowry definition is the most widely used definition unless otherwise specified acidbase reactions are assumed to involve the transfer of a proton h from an acid to a base hydronium ions are acids according to all three definitions interestingly although alcohols and amines can be brønstedlowry acids they can also function as lewis bases due to the lone pairs of electrons on their oxygen and nitrogen atoms arrhenius acids svante arrhenius the swedish chemist svante arrhenius attributed the properties of acidity to hydrogen ions h or protons in 1884 an arrhenius acid is a substance that when added to water increases the concentration of h ions in the water note that chemists often write haq and refer to the hydrogen ion when describing acidbase reactions but the free hydrogen nucleus a proton does not exist alone in water it exists as the hydronium ion h3o thus an arrhenius acid can also be described as a substance that increases the concentration of hydronium ions when added to water examples include molecular substances such as hcl and acetic acid an arrhenius base on the other hand is a substance which increases the concentration of hydroxide oh ions when dissolved in water this decreases the concentration of hydronium because the ions react to form h2o molecules h3o oh h2ol h2ol due to this equilibrium any increase in the concentration of hydronium is accompanied by a decrease in the concentration of hydroxide thus an arrhenius acid could also be said to be one that decreases hydroxide concentration while an arrhenius base increases it in an acidic solution the concentration of hydronium ions is greater than 107 moles per liter since ph is defined as the negative logarithm of the concentration of hydronium ions acidic solutions thus have a ph of less than 7 brønstedlowry acids acetic acid a weak acid donates a proton hydrogen ion highlighted in green to water in an equilibrium reaction to give the acetate ion and the hydronium ion red oxygen black carbon white hydrogen while the arrhenius concept is useful for describing many reactions it is also quite limited in its scope in 1923 chemists johannes nicolaus brønsted and thomas martin lowry independently recognized that acidbase reactions involve the transfer of a proton a brønstedlowry acid or simply brønsted acid is a species that donates a proton to a brønstedlowry base brønstedlowry acidbase theory has several advantages over arrhenius theory consider the following reactions of acetic acid ch3cooh the organic acid that gives vinegar its characteristic taste both theories easily describe the first reaction ch3cooh acts as an arrhenius acid because it acts as a source of h3o when dissolved in water and it acts as a brønsted acid by donating a proton to water in the second example ch3cooh undergoes the same transformation in this case donating a proton to ammonia nh3 but does not relate to the arrhenius definition of an acid because the reaction does not produce hydronium nevertheless ch3cooh is both an arrhenius and a brønstedlowry acid brønstedlowry theory can be used to describe reactions of molecular compounds in nonaqueous solution or the gas phase hydrogen chloride hcl and ammonia combine under several different conditions to form ammonium chloride nh4cl in aqueous solution hcl behaves as hydrochloric acid and exists as hydronium and chloride ions the following reactions illustrate the limitations of arrheniuss definition h3o cl nh3 cl nhaq h2o hclbenzene nh3benzene nh4cls hclg nh3g nh4cls as with the acetic acid reactions both definitions work for the first example where water is the solvent and hydronium ion is formed by the hcl solute the next two reactions do not involve the formation of ions but are still protontransfer reactions in the second reaction hydrogen chloride and ammonia dissolved in benzene react to form solid ammonium chloride in a benzene solvent and in the third gaseous hcl and nh3 combine to form the solid lewis acids a third only marginally related concept was proposed in 1923 by gilbert n lewis which includes reactions with acidbase characteristics that do not involve a proton transfer a lewis acid is a species that accepts a pair of electrons from another species in other words it is an electron pair acceptor brønsted acidbase reactions are proton transfer reactions while lewis acidbase reactions are electron pair transfers many lewis acids are not brønstedlowry acids contrast how the following reactions are described in terms of acidbase chemistry 374px in the first reaction a fluoride ion f gives up an electron pair to boron trifluoride to form the product tetrafluoroborate fluoride loses a pair of valence electrons because the electrons shared in the bf bond are located in the region of space between the two atomic nuclei and are therefore more distant from the fluoride nucleus than they are in the lone fluoride ion bf3 is a lewis acid because it accepts the electron pair from fluoride this reaction cannot be described in terms of brønsted theory because there is no proton transfer the second reaction can be described using either theory a proton is transferred from an unspecified brønsted acid to ammonia a brønsted base alternatively ammonia acts as a lewis base and transfers a lone pair of electrons to form a bond with a hydrogen ion the species that gains the electron pair is the lewis acid for example the oxygen atom in h3o gains a pair of electrons when one of the ho bonds is broken and the electrons shared in the bond become localized on oxygen depending on the context a lewis acid may also be described as an oxidizer or an electrophile organic brønsted acids such as acetic citric or oxalic acid are not lewis acids they dissociate in water to produce a lewis acid h but at the same time also yield an equal amount of a lewis base acetate citrate or oxalate respectively for the acids mentioned few if any of the acids discussed in the following are lewis acids
52,zinc a typical metal reacting with hydrochloric acid a typical acid an acid is a molecule or ion capable of donating a hydron proton or hydrogen ion h or alternatively capable of forming a covalent bond with an electron pair a lewis acid the first category of acids is the proton donors or brønsted acids in the special case of aqueous solutions proton donors form the hydronium ion h3o and are known as arrhenius acids brønsted and lowry generalized the arrhenius theory to include nonaqueous solvents a brønsted or arrhenius acid usually contains a hydrogen atom bonded to a chemical structure that is still energetically favorable after loss of h aqueous arrhenius acids have characteristic properties which provide a practical description of an acid acids form aqueous solutions with a sour taste can turn blue litmus red and react with bases and certain metals like calcium to form salts the word acid is derived from the latin acidusacēre meaning sour an aqueous solution of an acid has a ph less than 7 and is colloquially also referred to as acid as in dissolved in acid while the strict definition refers only to the solute a lower ph means a higher acidity and thus a higher concentration of positive hydrogen ions in the solution chemicals or substances having the property of an acid are said to be acidic common aqueous acids include hydrochloric acid a solution of hydrogen chloride which is found in gastric acid in the stomach and activates digestive enzymes acetic acid vinegar is a dilute aqueous solution of this liquid sulfuric acid used in car batteries and citric acid found in citrus fruits as these examples show acids in the colloquial sense can be solutions or pure substances and can be derived from acids in the strict sense that are solids liquids or gases strong acids and some concentrated weak acids are corrosive but there are exceptions such as carboranes and boric acid the second category of acids are lewis acids which form a covalent bond with an electron pair an example is boron trifluoride bf3 whose boron atom has a vacant orbital which can form a covalent bond by sharing a lone pair of electrons on an atom in a base for example the nitrogen atom in ammonia nh3 lewis considered this as a generalization of the brønsted definition so that an acid is a chemical species that accepts electron pairs either directly or by releasing protons h into the solution which then accept electron pairs however hydrogen chloride acetic acid and most other brønstedlowry acids cannot form a covalent bond with an electron pair and are therefore not lewis acids conversely many lewis acids are not arrhenius or brønstedlowry acids in modern terminology an acid is implicitly a brønsted acid and not a lewis acid since chemists almost always refer to a lewis acid explicitly as a lewis acid

52,monoprotic acids monoprotic acids are those acids that are able to donate one proton per molecule during the process of dissociation sometimes called ionization as shown below symbolized by ha haaq h2ol h3o a ka common examples of monoprotic acids in mineral acids include hydrochloric acid hcl and nitric acid hno3 on the other hand for organic acids the term mainly indicates the presence of one carboxylic acid group and sometimes these acids are known as monocarboxylic acid examples in organic acids include formic acid hcooh acetic acid ch3cooh and benzoic acid c6h5cooh polyprotic acids polyprotic acids also known as polybasic acids are able to donate more than one proton per acid molecule in contrast to monoprotic acids that only donate one proton per molecule specific types of polyprotic acids have more specific names such as diprotic acid two potential protons to donate and triprotic acid three potential protons to donate a diprotic acid here symbolized by h2a can undergo one or two dissociations depending on the ph each dissociation has its own dissociation constant ka1 and ka2 the first dissociation constant is typically greater than the second ie ka1 ka2 for example sulfuric acid h2so4 can donate one proton to form the bisulfate anion hso for which ka1 is very large then it can donate a second proton to form the sulfate anion so wherein the ka2 is intermediate strength the large ka1 for the first dissociation makes sulfuric a strong acid in a similar manner the weak unstable carbonic acid h2co3 can lose one proton to form bicarbonate anion hco and lose a second to form carbonate anion co both ka values are small but ka1 ka2 a triprotic acid h3a can undergo one two or three dissociations and has three dissociation constants where ka1 ka2 ka3 an inorganic example of a triprotic acid is orthophosphoric acid h3po4 usually just called phosphoric acid all three protons can be successively lost to yield h2po then hpo and finally po the orthophosphate ion usually just called phosphate even though the positions of the three protons on the original phosphoric acid molecule are equivalent the successive ka values differ since it is energetically less favorable to lose a proton if the conjugate base is more negatively charged an organic example of a triprotic acid is citric acid which can successively lose three protons to finally form the citrate ion although the subsequent loss of each hydrogen ion is less favorable all of the conjugate bases are present in solution the fractional concentration α alpha for each species can be calculated for example a generic diprotic acid will generate 3 species in solution h2a ha and a2 the fractional concentrations can be calculated as below when given either the ph which can be converted to the h or the concentrations of the acid with all its conjugate bases a plot of these fractional concentrations against ph for given k1 and k2 is known as a bjerrum plot a pattern is observed in the above equations and can be expanded to the general n protic acid that has been deprotonated i times where k0 1 and the other kterms are the dissociation constants for the acid neutralization hydrochloric acid in beaker reacting with ammonia fumes to produce ammonium chloride white smoke neutralization is the reaction between an acid and a base producing a salt and neutralized base for example hydrochloric acid and sodium hydroxide form sodium chloride and water hclaq naohaq h2ol naclaq neutralization is the basis of titration where a ph indicator shows equivalence point when the equivalent number of moles of a base have been added to an acid it is often wrongly assumed that neutralization should result in a solution with ph 70 which is only the case with similar acid and base strengths during a reaction neutralization with a base weaker than the acid results in a weakly acidic salt an example is the weakly acidic ammonium chloride which is produced from the strong acid hydrogen chloride and the weak base ammonia conversely neutralizing a weak acid with a strong base gives a weakly basic salt eg sodium fluoride from hydrogen fluoride and sodium hydroxide weak acidweak base equilibrium in order for a protonated acid to lose a proton the ph of the system must rise above the pka of the acid the decreased concentration of h in that basic solution shifts the equilibrium towards the conjugate base form the deprotonated form of the acid in lowerph more acidic solutions there is a high enough h concentration in the solution to cause the acid to remain in its protonated form solutions of weak acids and salts of their conjugate bases form buffer solutions

52,reactions of acids are often generalized in the form ha h a where ha represents the acid and a is the conjugate base this reaction is referred to as protolysis the protonated form ha of an acid is also sometimes referred to as the free acid acidbase conjugate pairs differ by one proton and can be interconverted by the addition or removal of a proton protonation and deprotonation respectively note that the acid can be the charged species and the conjugate base can be neutral in which case the generalized reaction scheme could be written as ha h a in solution there exists an equilibrium between the acid and its conjugate base the equilibrium constant k is an expression of the equilibrium concentrations of the molecules or the ions in solution brackets indicate concentration such that h2o means the concentration of h2o the acid dissociation constant ka is generally used in the context of acidbase reactions the numerical value of ka is equal to the product of the concentrations of the products divided by the concentration of the reactants where the reactant is the acid ha and the products are the conjugate base and h the stronger of two acids will have a higher ka than the weaker acid the ratio of hydrogen ions to acid will be higher for the stronger acid as the stronger acid has a greater tendency to lose its proton because the range of possible values for ka spans many orders of magnitude a more manageable constant pka is more frequently used where pka log10 ka stronger acids have a smaller pka than weaker acids experimentally determined pka at 25 c in aqueous solution are often quoted in textbooks and reference material

53,etymology the word asphalt is derived from the late middle english in turn from french asphalte based on late latin asphalton asphaltum which is the latinisation of the greek ἄσφαλτος ásphaltos ásphalton a word meaning asphaltbitumenpitch which perhaps derives from ἀ without and σφάλλω sfallō make fall the first use of asphalt by the ancients was in the nature of a cement for securing or joining together various objects and it thus seems likely that the name itself was expressive of this application specifically herodotus mentioned that bitumen was brought to babylon to build its gigantic fortification wall from the greek the word passed into late latin and thence into french asphalte and english asphaltum and asphalt in french the term asphalte is used for naturally occurring asphaltsoaked limestone deposits and for specialised manufactured products with fewer voids or greater bitumen content than the asphaltic concrete used to pave roads the expression bitumen originated in the sanskrit words jatu meaning pitch and jatukrit meaning pitch creating or pitch producing referring to coniferous or resinous trees the latin equivalent is claimed by some to be originally gwitumen pertaining to pitch and by others pixtumens exuding or bubbling pitch which was subsequently shortened to bitumen thence passing via french into english from the same root is derived the anglosaxon word cwidu mastix the german word kitt cement or mastic and the old norse word kvada modern terminology in british english bitumen is used instead of asphalt the word asphalt is instead used to refer to asphalt concrete a mixture of construction aggregate and asphalt itself also called tarmac in common parlance bitumen mixed with clay was usually called asphaltum but the term is less commonly used today in australian english bitumen is often used as the generic term for road surfaces in american english asphalt is equivalent to the british bitumen however asphalt is also commonly used as a shortened form of asphalt concrete therefore equivalent to the british asphalt or tarmac in canadian english the word bitumen is used to refer to the vast canadian deposits of extremely heavy crude oil while asphalt is used for the oil refinery product diluted bitumen diluted with naphtha to make it flow in pipelines is known as dilbit in the canadian petroleum industry while bitumen upgraded to synthetic crude oil is known as syncrude and syncrude blended with bitumen is called synbit bitumen is still the preferred geological term for naturally occurring deposits of the solid or semisolid form of petroleum bituminous rock is a form of sandstone impregnated with bitumen the tar sands of alberta canada are a similar material neither of the terms asphalt or bitumen should be confused with tar or coal tars
53,natural bitumen from the dead sea refined asphalt the university of queensland pitch drop experiment demonstrating the viscosity of asphalt asphalt also known as bitumen is a sticky black and highly viscous liquid or semisolid form of petroleum it may be found in natural deposits or may be a refined product and is classed as a pitch before the 20th century the term asphaltum was also used the word is derived from the ancient greek ἄσφαλτος ásphaltos the primary use 70 of asphalt is in road construction where it is used as the glue or binder mixed with aggregate particles to create asphalt concrete its other main uses are for bituminous waterproofing products including production of roofing felt and for sealing flat roofs the terms asphalt and bitumen are often used interchangeably to mean both natural and manufactured forms of the substance in american english asphalt or asphalt cement is commonly used for a refined residue from the distillation process of selected crude oils outside the united states the product is often called bitumen and geologists worldwide often prefer the term for the naturally occurring variety common colloquial usage often refers to various forms of asphalt as tar as in the name of the la brea tar pits naturally occurring asphalt is sometimes specified by the term crude bitumen its viscosity is similar to that of cold molasses while the material obtained from the fractional distillation of crude oil boiling at is sometimes referred to as refined bitumen the canadian province of alberta has most of the worlds reserves of natural asphalt covering an area larger than england
53,global use the vast majority of refined asphalt is used in construction primarily as a constituent of products used in paving and roofing applications according to the requirements of the end use asphalt is produced to specification this is achieved either by refining or blending it is estimated that the current world use of asphalt is approximately 102 million tonnes per year approximately 85 of all the asphalt produced is used as the binder in asphalt concrete for roads it is also used in other paved areas such as airport runways car parks and footways typically the production of asphalt concrete involves mixing fine and coarse aggregates such as sand gravel and crushed rock with asphalt which acts as the binding agent other materials such as recycled polymers eg rubber tyres may be added to the asphalt to modify its properties according to the application for which the asphalt is ultimately intended a further 10 of global asphalt production is used in roofing applications where its waterproofing qualities are invaluable the remaining 5 of asphalt is used mainly for sealing and insulating purposes in a variety of building materials such as pipe coatings carpet tile backing and paint asphalt is applied in the construction and maintenance of many structures systems and components such as the following highways airport runways footways and pedestrian ways car parks racetracks tennis courts roofing damp proofing dams reservoir and pool linings soundproofing pipe coatings cable coatings paints building water proofing tile underlying waterproofing newspaper ink production and many other applications rolled asphalt concrete the largest use of asphalt is for making asphalt concrete for road surfaces this accounts for approximately 85 of the asphalt consumed in the united states asphalt concrete pavement mixes are typically composed of 5 asphalt cement and 95 aggregates stone sand and gravel due to its highly viscous nature asphalt cement must be heated so it can be mixed with the aggregates at the asphalt mixing facility the temperature required varies depending upon characteristics of the asphalt and the aggregates but warmmix asphalt technologies allow producers to reduce the temperature required there are about 4000 asphalt concrete mixing plants in the us and a similar number in europe when maintenance is performed on asphalt pavements such as milling to remove a worn or damaged surface the removed material can be returned to a facility for processing into new pavement mixtures the asphalt in the removed material can be reactivated and put back to use in new pavement mixes with some 95 of paved roads being constructed of or surfaced with asphalt a substantial amount of asphalt pavement material is reclaimed each year according to industry surveys conducted annually by the federal highway administration and the national asphalt pavement association more than 99 of the asphalt removed each year from road surfaces during widening and resurfacing projects is reused as part of new pavements roadbeds shoulders and embankments asphalt concrete paving is widely used in airports around the world due to the sturdiness and ability to be repaired quickly it is widely used for runways mastic asphalt mastic asphalt is a type of asphalt that differs from dense graded asphalt asphalt concrete in that it has a higher asphalt binder content usually around 710 of the whole aggregate mix as opposed to rolled asphalt concrete which has only around 5 asphalt this thermoplastic substance is widely used in the building industry for waterproofing flat roofs and tanking underground mastic asphalt is heated to a temperature of and is spread in layers to form an impervious barrier about thick asphalt emulsion a number of technologies allow asphalt to be mixed at much lower temperatures these involve mixing with petroleum solvents to form cutbacks with reduced melting point or mixing with water to turn the asphalt into an emulsion asphalt emulsions contain up to 70 asphalt and typically less than 15 chemical additives there are two main types of emulsions with different affinity for aggregates cationic and anionic asphalt emulsions are used in a wide variety of applications chipseal involves spraying the road surface with asphalt emulsion followed by a layer of crushed rock gravel or crushed slag slurry seal involves the creation of a mixture of asphalt emulsion and fine crushed aggregate that is spread on the surface of a road coldmixed asphalt can also be made from asphalt emulsion to create pavements similar to hotmixed asphalt several inches in depth and asphalt emulsions are also blended into recycled hotmix asphalt to create lowcost pavements synthetic crude oil synthetic crude oil also known as syncrude is the output from a bitumen upgrader facility used in connection with oil sand production in canada bituminous sands are mined using enormous 100 ton capacity power shovels and loaded into even larger 400 ton capacity dump trucks for movement to an upgrading facility the process used to extract the bitumen from the sand is a hot water process originally developed by dr karl clark of the university of alberta during the 1920s after extraction from the sand the bitumen is fed into a bitumen upgrader which converts it into a light crude oil equivalent this synthetic substance is fluid enough to be transferred through conventional oil pipelines and can be fed into conventional oil refineries without any further treatment by 2015 canadian bitumen upgraders were producing over per day of synthetic crude oil of which 75 was exported to oil refineries in the united states in alberta five bitumen upgraders produce synthetic crude oil and a variety of other products the suncor energy upgrader near fort mcmurray alberta produces synthetic crude oil plus diesel fuel the syncrude canada canadian natural resources and nexen upgraders near fort mcmurray produce synthetic crude oil and the shell scotford upgrader near edmonton produces synthetic crude oil plus an intermediate feedstock for the nearby shell oil refinery a sixth upgrader under construction in 2015 near redwater alberta will upgrade half of its crude bitumen directly to diesel fuel with the remainder of the output being sold as feedstock to nearby oil refineries and petrochemical plants nonupgraded crude bitumen canadian bitumen does not differ substantially from oils such as venezuelan extraheavy and mexican heavy oil in chemical composition and the real difficulty is moving the extremely viscous bitumen through oil pipelines to the refinery many modern oil refineries are extremely sophisticated and can process nonupgraded bitumen directly into products such as gasoline diesel fuel and refined asphalt without any preprocessing this is particularly common in areas such as the us gulf coast where refineries were designed to process venezuelan and mexican oil and in areas such as the us midwest where refineries were rebuilt to process heavy oil as domestic light oil production declined given the choice such heavy oil refineries usually prefer to buy bitumen rather than synthetic oil because the cost is lower and in some cases because they prefer to produce more diesel fuel and less gasoline by 2015 canadian production and exports of nonupgraded bitumen exceeded that of synthetic crude oil at over per day of which about 65 was exported to the united states because of the difficulty of moving crude bitumen through pipelines nonupgraded bitumen is usually diluted with naturalgas condensate in a form called dilbit or with synthetic crude oil called synbit however to meet international competition much nonupgraded bitumen is now sold as a blend of multiple grades of bitumen conventional crude oil synthetic crude oil and condensate in a standardized benchmark product such as western canadian select this sour heavy crude oil blend is designed to have uniform refining characteristics to compete with internationally marketed heavy oils such as mexican mayan or arabian dubai crude radioactive waste encapsulation matrix asphalt was used starting in the 1960s as an hydrophobic matrix aiming to encapsulate radioactive waste such as mediumactivity salts mainly soluble sodium nitrate and sodium sulfate produced by the reprocessing of spent nuclear fuels or radioactive sludges from sedimentation ponds bituminised radioactive waste containing highly radiotoxic alphaemitting transuranic elements from nuclear reprocessing plants have been produced at industrial scale in france belgium and japan but this type of waste conditioning has been abandoned because operational safety issues risks of fire as occurred in a bituminisation plant at tokai works in japan and longterm stability problems related to their geological disposal in deep rock formations one of the main problem is the swelling of asphalt exposed to radiation and to water asphalt swelling is first induced by radiation because of the presence of hydrogen gas bubbles generated by alpha and gamma radiolysis a second mechanism is the matrix swelling when the encapsulated hygroscopic salts exposed to water or moisture start to rehydrate and to dissolve the high concentration of salt in the pore solution inside the bituminised matrix is then responsible for osmotic effects inside the bituminised matrix the water moves in the direction of the concentrated salts the asphalt acting as a semipermeable membrane this also causes the matrix to swell the swelling pressure due to osmotic effect under constant volume can be as high as 200 bar if not properly managed this high pressure can cause fractures in the near field of a disposal gallery of bituminised mediumlevel waste when the bituminised matrix has been altered by swelling encapsulated radionuclides are easily leached by the contact of ground water and released in the geosphere the high ionic strength of the concentrated saline solution also favours the migration of radionuclides in clay host rocks the presence of chemically reactive nitrate can also affect the redox conditions prevailing in the host rock by establishing oxidizing conditions preventing the reduction of redoxsensitive radionuclides under their higher valences radionuclides of elements such as selenium technetium uranium neptunium and plutonium have an higher solubility and are also often present in water as nonretarded anions this makes the disposal of mediumlevel bituminised waste very challenging different type of asphalt have been used blown bitumen partly oxidized with air oxygen at high temperature after distillation and harder and direct distillation bitumen softer blown bitumens like mexphalte with a high content of saturated hydrocarbons are more easily biodegraded by microorganisms than direct distillation bitumen with a low content of saturated hydrocarbons and a high content of aromatic hydrocarbons concrete encapsulation of radwaste is presently considered a safer alternative by the nuclear industry and the waste management organisations other uses roofing shingles account for most of the remaining asphalt consumption other uses include cattle sprays fencepost treatments and waterproofing for fabrics asphalt is used to make japan black a lacquer known especially for its use on iron and steel and it is also used in paint and marker inks by some exterior paint supply companies to increase the weather resistance and permanence of the paint or ink and to make the color darker asphalt is also used to seal some alkaline batteries during the manufacturing process

53,the components of asphalt include four main classes of compounds naphthene aromatics naphthalene consisting of partially hydrogenated polycyclic aromatic compounds polar aromatics consisting of high molecular weight phenols and carboxylic acids produced by partial oxidation of the material saturated hydrocarbons the percentage of saturated compounds in asphalt correlates with its softening point asphaltenes consisting of high molecular weight phenols and heterocyclic compounds the naphthene aromatics and polar aromatics are typically the majority components most natural bitumens also contain organosulfur compounds resulting in an overall sulfur content of up to 4 nickel and vanadium are found at 10 parts per million as is typical of some petroleum the substance is soluble in carbon disulfide it is commonly modelled as a colloid with asphaltenes as the dispersed phase and maltenes as the continuous phase it is almost impossible to separate and identify all the different molecules of asphalt because the number of molecules with different chemical structure is extremely large asphalt may be confused with coal tar which is a visually similar black thermoplastic material produced by the destructive distillation of coal during the early and mid20th century when town gas was produced coal tar was a readily available byproduct and extensively used as the binder for road aggregates the addition of coal tar to macadam roads led to the word tarmac which is now used in common parlance to refer to roadmaking materials however since the 1970s when natural gas succeeded town gas asphalt has completely overtaken the use of coal tar in these applications other examples of this confusion include the la brea tar pits and the canadian oil sands both of which actually contain natural bitumen rather than tar pitch is another term sometimes informally used at times to refer to asphalt as in pitch lake
53,bituminous outcrop of the puy de la poix clermontferrand france the majority of asphalt used commercially is obtained from petroleum nonetheless large amounts of asphalt occur in concentrated form in nature naturally occurring deposits of bitumen are formed from the remains of ancient microscopic algae diatoms and other onceliving things these remains were deposited in the mud on the bottom of the ocean or lake where the organisms lived under the heat above 50 c and pressure of burial deep in the earth the remains were transformed into materials such as bitumen kerogen or petroleum natural deposits of bitumen include lakes such as the pitch lake in trinidad and tobago and lake bermudez in venezuela natural seeps occur in the la brea tar pits and in the dead sea bitumen also occurs in unconsolidated sandstones known as oil sands in alberta canada and the similar tar sands in utah us the canadian province of alberta has most of the worlds reserves in three huge deposits covering an area larger than england or new york state these bituminous sands contain of commercially established oil reserves giving canada the third largest oil reserves in the world although historically it was used without refining to pave roads nearly all of the output is now used as raw material for oil refineries in canada and the united states the worlds largest deposit of natural bitumen known as the athabasca oil sands is located in the mcmurray formation of northern alberta this formation is from the early cretaceous and is composed of numerous lenses of oilbearing sand with up to 20 oil isotopic studies show the oil deposits to be about 110 million years old two smaller but still very large formations occur in the peace river oil sands and the cold lake oil sands to the west and southeast of the athabasca oil sands respectively of the alberta deposits only parts of the athabasca oil sands are shallow enough to be suitable for surface mining the other 80 has to be produced by oil wells using enhanced oil recovery techniques like steamassisted gravity drainage much smaller heavy oil or bitumen deposits also occur in the uinta basin in utah us the tar sand triangle deposit for example is roughly 6 bitumen bitumen may occur in hydrothermal veins an example of this is within the uinta basin of utah in the us where there is a swarm of laterally and vertically extensive veins composed of a solid hydrocarbon termed gilsonite these veins formed by the polymerization and solidification of hydrocarbons that were mobilized from the deeper oil shales of the green river formation during burial and diagenesis bitumen is similar to the organic matter in carbonaceous meteorites however detailed studies have shown these materials to be distinct the vast alberta bitumen resources are considered to have started out as living material from marine plants and animals mainly algae that died millions of years ago when an ancient ocean covered alberta they were covered by mud buried deeply over time and gently cooked into oil by geothermal heat at a temperature of due to pressure from the rising of the rocky mountains in southwestern alberta 80 to 55 million years ago the oil was driven northeast hundreds of kilometres and trapped into underground sand deposits left behind by ancient river beds and ocean beaches thus forming the oil sands
53,people can be exposed to asphalt in the workplace by breathing in fumes or skin absorption the national institute for occupational safety and health niosh has set a recommended exposure limit of 5 mgm3 over a 15minute period asphalt is basically an inert material that must be heated or diluted to a point where it becomes workable for the production of materials for paving roofing and other applications in examining the potential health hazards associated with asphalt the international agency for research on cancer iarc determined that it is the application parameters predominantly temperature that affect occupational exposure and the potential bioavailable carcinogenic hazardrisk of the asphalt emissions in particular temperatures greater than 199 c 390 f were shown to produce a greater exposure risk than when asphalt was heated to lower temperatures such as those typically used in asphalt pavement mix production and placement iarc has classified asphalt as a class 2b possible carcinogen an asphalt mixing plant for hot aggregate

53,typical asphalt plant for making asphalt about 40000000 tons were produced in 1984 it is obtained as the heavy ie difficult to distill fraction material with a boiling point greater than around 500 c is considered asphalt vacuum distillation separates it from the other components in crude oil such as naphtha gasoline and diesel the resulting material is typically further treated to extract small but valuable amounts of lubricants and to adjust the properties of the material to suit applications in a deasphalting unit the crude asphalt is treated with either propane or butane in a supercritical phase to extract the lighter molecules which are then separated further processing is possible by blowing the product namely reacting it with oxygen this step makes the product harder and more viscous asphalt is typically stored and transported at temperatures around sometimes diesel oil or kerosene are mixed in before shipping to retain liquidity upon delivery these lighter materials are separated out of the mixture this mixture is often called bitumen feedstock or bfs some dump trucks route the hot engine exhaust through pipes in the dump body to keep the material warm the backs of tippers carrying asphalt as well as some handling equipment are also commonly sprayed with a releasing agent before filling to aid release diesel oil is no longer used as a release agent due to environmental concerns oil sands naturally occurring crude bitumen impregnated in sedimentary rock is the prime feed stock for petroleum production from oil sands currently under development in alberta canada canada has most of the worlds supply of natural bitumen covering 140000 square kilometres an area larger than england giving it the secondlargest proven oil reserves in the world the athabasca oil sands are the largest bitumen deposit in canada and the only one accessible to surface mining although recent technological breakthroughs have resulted in deeper deposits becoming producible by in situ methods because of oil price increases after 2003 producing bitumen became highly profitable but as a result of the decline after 2014 it became uneconomic to build new plants again by 2014 canadian crude bitumen production averaged about per day and was projected to rise to per day by 2020 the total amount of crude bitumen in alberta that could be extracted is estimated to be about which at a rate of would last about 200 years alternatives and bioasphalt although uncompetitive economically asphalt can be made from nonpetroleumbased renewable resources such as sugar molasses and rice corn and potato starches asphalt can also be made from waste material by fractional distillation of used motor oil which is sometimes otherwise disposed of by burning or dumping into landfills use of motor oil may cause premature cracking in colder climates resulting in roads that need to be repaved more frequently nonpetroleumbased asphalt binders can be made lightcolored lightercolored roads absorb less heat from solar radiation reducing their contribution to the urban heat island effect parking lots that use asphalt alternatives are called green parking lots albanian deposits selenizza is a naturally occurring solid hydrocarbon bitumen found in native deposits in selenice in albania the only european asphalt mine still in use the bitumen is found in the form of veins filling cracks in a more or less horizontal direction the bitumen content varies from 83 to 92 soluble in carbon disulphide with a penetration value near to zero and a softening point ring and ball around 120 c the insoluble matter consisting mainly of silica ore ranges from 8 to 17 albanian bitumen extraction has a long history and was practiced in an organized way by the romans after centuries of silence the first mentions of albanian bitumen appeared only in 1868 when the frenchman coquand published the first geological description of the deposits of albanian bitumen in 1875 the exploitation rights were granted to the ottoman government and in 1912 they were transferred to the italian company simsa since 1945 the mine was exploited by the albanian government and from 2001 to date the management passed to a french company which organized the mining process for the manufacture of the natural bitumen on an industrial scale today the mine is predominantly exploited in an open pit quarry but several of the many underground mines deep and extending over several km still remain viable selenizza is produced primarily in granular form after melting the bitumen pieces selected in the mine selenizza is mainly used as an additive in the road construction sector it is mixed with traditional asphalt to improve both the viscoelastic properties and the resistance to ageing it may be blended with the hot asphalt in tanks but its granular form allows it to be fed in the mixer or in the recycling ring of normal asphalt plants other typical applications include the production of mastic asphalts for sidewalks bridges carparks and urban roads as well as drilling fluid additives for the oil and gas industry selenizza is available in powder or in granular material of various particle sizes and is packaged in sacks or in thermal fusible polyethylene bags a lifecycle assessment study of the natural selenizza compared with petroleum asphalt has shown that the environmental impact of the selenizza is about half the impact of the road asphalt produced in oil refineries in terms of carbon dioxide emission
53,ancient times the use of asphalt for waterproofing and as an adhesive dates at least to the fifth millennium bc in the early indus valley sites like mehrgarh where it was used to line the baskets in which crops were gathered in the ancient middle east the sumerians used natural bitumen deposits for mortar between bricks and stones to cement parts of carvings such as eyes into place for ship caulking and for waterproofing the greek historian herodotus said hot bitumen was used as mortar in the walls of babylon the long euphrates tunnel beneath the river euphrates at babylon in the time of queen semiramis ca 800 bc was reportedly constructed of burnt bricks covered with bitumen as a waterproofing agent bitumen was used by ancient egyptians to embalm mummies the persian word for asphalt is moom which is related to the english word mummy the egyptians primary source of bitumen was the dead sea which the romans knew as palus asphaltites asphalt lake approximately 40 ad dioscorides described the dead sea material as judaicum bitumen and noted other places in the region where it could be found the sidon bitumen is thought to refer to materiall found at hasbeya pliny refers also to bitumen being found in epirus it was a valuable strategic resource the object of the first known battle for a hydrocarbon depositbetween the seleucids and the nabateans in 312 bc in the ancient far east natural bitumen was slowly boiled to get rid of the higher fractions leaving a thermoplastic material of higher molecular weight that when layered on objects became quite hard upon cooling this was used to cover objects that needed waterproofing such as scabbards and other items statuettes of household deities were also cast with this type of material in japan and probably also in china in north america archaeological recovery has indicated bitumen was sometimes used to adhere stone projectile points to wooden shafts in canada aboriginal people used bitumen seeping out of the banks of the athabasca and other rivers to waterproof birch bark canoes and also heated it in smudge pots to ward off mosquitoes in the summer continental europe in 1553 pierre belon described in his work observations that pissasphalto a mixture of pitch and bitumen was used in the republic of ragusa now dubrovnik croatia for tarring of ships an 1838 edition of mechanics magazine cites an early use of asphalt in france a pamphlet dated 1621 by a certain monsieur deyrinys states that he had discovered the existence of asphaltum in large quantities in the vicinity of neufchatel and that he proposed to use it in a variety of ways principally in the construction of airproof granaries and in protecting by means of the arches the watercourses in the city of paris from the intrusion of dirt and filth which at that time made the water unusable he expatiates also on the excellence of this material for forming level and durable terraces in palaces the notion of forming such terraces in the streets not one likely to cross the brain of a parisian of that generation but the substance was generally neglected in france until the revolution of 1830 in the 1830s there was a surge of interest and asphalt became widely used for pavements flat roofs and the lining of cisterns and in england some use of it had been made of it for similar purposes its rise in europe was a sudden phenomenon after natural deposits were found in france at osbann basrhin the parc ain and the puydelapoix puydedôme although it could also be made artificially one of the earliest uses in france was the laying of about 24000 square yards of seyssel asphalt at the place de la concorde in 1835 united kingdom among the earlier uses of bitumen in the united kingdom was for etching william salmons polygraphice 1673 provides a recipe for varnish used in etching consisting of three ounces of virgin wax two ounces of mastic and one ounce of asphaltum by the fifth edition in 1685 he had included more asphaltum recipes from other sources the first british patent for the use of asphalt was cassells patent asphalte or bitumen in 1834 then on 25 november 1837 richard tappin claridge patented the use of seyssel asphalt patent 7849 for use in asphalte pavement having seen it employed in france and belgium when visiting with frederick walter simms who worked with him on the introduction of asphalt to britain dr t lamb phipson writes that his father samuel ryland phipson a friend of claridge was also instrumental in introducing the asphalte pavement in 1836 indeed mastic pavements had been previously employed at vauxhall by a competitor of claridge but without success claridge obtained a patent in scotland on 27 march 1838 and obtained a patent in ireland on 23 april 1838 in 1851 extensions for the 1837 patent and for both 1838 patents were sought by the trustees of a company previously formed by claridge claridges patent asphalte companyformed in 1838 for the purpose of introducing to britain asphalte in its natural state from the mine at pyrimont seysell in francelaid one of the first asphalt pavements in whitehall trials were made of the pavement in 1838 on the footway in whitehall the stable at knightsbridge barracks and subsequently on the space at the bottom of the steps leading from waterloo place to st james park the formation in 1838 of claridges patent asphalte company with a distinguished list of aristocratic patrons and marc and isambard brunel as respectively a trustee and consulting engineer gave an enormous impetus to the development of a british asphalt industry by the end of 1838 at least two other companies robinsons and the bastenne company were in production with asphalt being laid as paving at brighton herne bay canterbury kensington the strand and a large floor area in bunhillrow while meantime claridges whitehall paving continued in good order in 1838 there was a flurry of entrepreneurial activity involving asphalt which had uses beyond paving for example asphalt could also be used for flooring damp proofing in buildings and for waterproofing of various types of pools and baths both of which were also proliferating in the 19th century on the london stockmarket there were various claims as to the exclusivity of asphalt quality from france germany and england and numerous patents were granted in france with similar numbers of patent applications being denied in england due to their similarity to each other in england claridges was the type most used in the 1840s and 50s in 1914 claridges company entered into a joint venture to produce tarbound macadam with materials manufactured through a subsidiary company called clarmac roads ltd two products resulted namely clarmac and clarphalte with the former being manufactured by clarmac roads and the latter by claridges patent asphalte co although clarmac was more widely used however the first world war ruined the clarmac company which entered into liquidation in 1915 the failure of clarmac roads ltd had a flowon effect to claridges company which was itself compulsorily wound up ceasing operations in 1917 having invested a substantial amount of funds into the new venture both at the outset and in a subsequent attempt to save the clarmac company united states the first use of bitumen in the new world was by indigenous peoples on the west coast as early as the 13th century the tongva luiseño and chumash peoples collected the naturally occurring bitumen that seeped to the surface above underlying petroleum deposits all three groups used the substance as an adhesive it is found on many different artifacts of tools and ceremonial items for example it was used on rattles to adhere gourds or turtle shells to rattle handles it was also used in decorations small round shell beads were often set in asphaltum to provide decorations it was used as a sealant on baskets to make them watertight for carrying water possibly poisoning those who drank the water asphalt was used also to seal the planks on oceangoing canoes roads in the us have been paved with materials that include asphalt since at least 1870 when a street in front of the newark new jersey city hall was paved in many cases these early pavings were made from naturally occurring bituminous rock such as at ritchie mines in macfarlan in ritchie county west virginia from 1852 to 1873 in 1876 asphaltbased paving was used to pave pennsylvania avenue in washington dc in time for the celebration of the national centennial asphalt was also used for flooring paving and waterproofing of baths and swimming pools during the early 20th century following similar trends in europe canada canada has the worlds largest deposit of natural bitumen in the athabasca oil sands and canadian first nations along the athabasca river had long used it to waterproof their canoes in 1719 a cree named wapasu brought a sample for trade to henry kelsey of the hudsons bay company who was the first recorded european to see it however it wasnt until 1787 that fur trader and explorer alexander mackenzie saw the athabasca oil sands and said at about 24 miles from the fork of the athabasca and clearwater rivers are some bituminous fountains into which a pole of 20 feet long may be inserted without the least resistance the value of the deposit was obvious from the start but the means of extracting the bitumen was not the nearest town fort mcmurray alberta was a small fur trading post other markets were far away and transportation costs were too high to ship the raw bituminous sand for paving in 1915 sidney ells of the federal mines branch experimented with separation techniques and used the product to pave 600 feet of road in edmonton alberta other roads in alberta were paved with material extracted from oil sands but it was generally not economic during the 1920s dr karl a clark of the alberta research council patented a hot water oil separation process and entrepreneur robert c fitzsimmons built the bitumount oil separation plant which between 1925 and 1958 produced up to per day of bitumen using dr clarks method most of the bitumen was used for waterproofing roofs but other uses included fuels lubrication oils printers ink medicines rust and acidproof paints fireproof roofing street paving patent leather and fence post preservatives eventually fitzsimmons ran out of money and the plant was taken over by the alberta government today the bitumount plant is a provincial historic site photography and art bitumen was used in early photographic technology in 1826 or 1827 it was used by french scientist joseph nicéphore niépce to make the oldest surviving photograph from nature the bitumen was thinly coated onto a pewter plate which was then exposed in a camera exposure to light hardened the bitumen and made it insoluble so that when it was subsequently rinsed with a solvent only the sufficiently lightstruck areas remained many hours of exposure in the camera were required making bitumen impractical for ordinary photography but from the 1850s to the 1920s it was in common use as a photoresist in the production of printing plates for various photomechanical printing processes bitumen was the nemesis of many artists during the 19th century although widely used for a time it ultimately proved unstable for use in oil painting especially when mixed with the most common diluents such as linseed oil varnish and turpentine unless thoroughly diluted bitumen never fully solidifies and will in time corrupt the other pigments with which it comes into contact the use of bitumen as a glaze to set in shadow or mixed with other colors to render a darker tone resulted in the eventual deterioration of many paintings for instance those of delacroix perhaps the most famous example of the destructiveness of bitumen is théodore géricaults raft of the medusa 18181819 where his use of bitumen caused the brilliant colors to degenerate into dark greens and blacks and the paint and canvas to buckle

separating from columbia james lovell and fred haise listening in during apollo 11s descent on july 20 1969 the lunar module eagle separated from the command module columbia collins alone aboard columbia inspected eagle as it pirouetted before him to ensure the craft was not damaged as the descent began armstrong and aldrin found that they were passing landmarks on the surface four seconds early and reported that they were long they would land miles west of their target point five minutes into the descent burn and above the surface of the moon the lm navigation and guidance computer distracted the crew with the first of several unexpected 1202 and 1201 program alarms inside mission control center in houston texas computer engineer jack garman told guidance officer steve bales it was safe to continue the descent and this was relayed to the crew the program alarms indicated executive overflows meaning the guidance computer could not complete all of its tasks in real time and

target was in a boulderstrewn area just north and east of a diameter crater later determined to be west crater named for its location in the western part of the originally planned landing ellipse armstrong took semiautomatic control and with aldrin calling out altitude and velocity data landed at 201740 utc on sunday july 20 with about 25 seconds of fuel left apollo 11 landed with less fuel than other missions and the astronauts encountered a premature low fuel warning this was later found to be the result of greater propellant slosh than expected uncovering a fuel sensor on subsequent missions extra antislosh baffles were added to the tanks to prevent this throughout the descent aldrin had called out navigation data to armstrong who was busy piloting the lm a few moments before the landing a light informed aldrin that at least one of the probes hanging from eagle footpads had touched the surface and he said contact light three seconds later eagle landed and armstrong said shutdown aldrin immediately said okay engine stop aca out of detent armstrong acknowledged out of detent auto and aldrin continued mode control both auto descent engine command override off engine arm

listeners that landing was complete and successful duke mispronounced his reply as he expressed the relief at mission control roger twan tranquility we copy you on the ground you got a bunch of guys about to turn blue were breathing again thanks a lot two and a half hours after landing before preparations began for the eva aldrin radioed to earth he then took communion privately at this time nasa was still fighting a lawsuit brought by atheist madalyn murray ohair who had objected to the apollo 8 crew reading from the book of genesis demanding that their astronauts refrain from broadcasting religious activities while in space as such aldrin chose to refrain from directly mentioning taking communion on the moon aldrin was an elder at the webster presbyterian church and his communion kit was prepared by the pastor of the church the rev dean woodruff aldrin described communion on the moon and the involvement of his church and pastor in the october 1970 edition of guideposts magazine and in his book return to earth webster presbyterian possesses the chalice used on the moon and commemorates the event each year on the sunday closest to july 20 the schedule for the mission called for the astronauts to follow the landing with a fivehour sleep period as they had been awake since early morning however they elected to forgo the sleep period and begin the preparations for the eva early thinking that they would be unable to sleep lunar surface operations mounted slowscan tv camera showing armstrong as he climbs down the ladder to surface lm taken by aldrin on the lunar surface most of the time armstrong had the camera the astronauts planned placement of the early apollo scientific experiment package easep and the us flag by studying their landing site through eagle twin triangular windows which gave them a 60 field of view preparation required longer than the two hours scheduled armstrong initially had some difficulties squeezing through the hatch with his portable life support system plss according to veteran moonwalker john young a redesign of the lm to incorporate a smaller hatch had not been followed by a redesign of the plss backpack so some of the highest heart rates recorded from apollo astronauts occurred during lm egress and ingress several books indicate early mission timelines had buzz aldrin rather than neil armstrong as the first man on the moon at 0239 utc on monday july 21 1969 armstrong opened the hatch and at 0251 utc began his descent to the lunar surface the remote control unit controls on his chest kept him from seeing his feet climbing down the ninerung ladder armstrong pulled a dring to deploy the modular equipment stowage assembly mesa folded against eagle side and activate the tv camera and at 025615 utc he set his left foot on the surface the first landing used slowscan television incompatible with commercial tv so it was displayed on a special monitor and a conventional tv camera viewed this monitor significantly reducing the quality of the picture the signal was received at goldstone in the united states but with better fidelity by honeysuckle creek tracking station in australia minutes later the feed was switched to the more sensitive parkes radio telescope in australia despite some technical and weather difficulties ghostly black and white images of the first lunar eva were received and broadcast to at least 600 million people on earth although copies of this video in broadcast format were saved and are widely available recordings of the original slow scan source transmission from the lunar surface were accidentally destroyed during routine magnetic tape reuse at nasa the plaque left on the ladder of eagle while still on the ladder armstrong uncovered a plaque mounted on the lm descent stage bearing two drawings of earth of the western and eastern hemispheres an inscription and signatures of the astronauts and president nixon the inscription read after describing the surface dust as very finegrained and almost like a powder six and a half hours after landing armstrong stepped off eagle footpad and declared thats one small step for a man one giant leap for mankind armstrong intended to say thats one small step for a man but the word a is not audible in the transmission and thus was not initially reported by most observers of the live broadcast when later asked about his quote armstrong said he believed he said for a man and subsequent printed versions of the quote included the a in square brackets one explanation for the absence may be that his accent caused him to slur the words for a together another is the intermittent nature of the audio and video links to earth partly because of storms near parkes observatory more recent digital analysis of the tape claims to reveal the a may have been spoken but obscured by static about seven minutes after stepping onto the moons surface armstrong collected a contingency soil sample using a sample bag on a stick he then folded the bag and tucked it into a pocket on his right thigh this was to guarantee there would be some lunar soil brought back in case an emergency required the astronauts to abandon the eva and return to the lm twelve minutes after the contingency sample was collected aldrin joined armstrong on the surface and described the view with the simple phrase magnificent desolation aldrin poses on the moon allowing armstrong to photograph both of them using the visors reflection in addition to fulfilling president kennedys mandate to land a man on the moon before the end of the 1960s apollo 11 was an engineering test of the apollo system therefore armstrong snapped photos of the lm so engineers would be able to judge its postlanding condition he removed the tv camera from the mesa and made a panoramic sweep then mounted it on a tripod from the lm the tv camera cable remained partly coiled and presented a tripping hazard throughout the eva armstrong said that moving in the lunar gravity onesixth of earths was even perhaps easier than the simulations its absolutely no trouble to walk around aldrin joined him on the surface and tested methods for moving around including twofooted kangaroo hops the plss backpack created a tendency to tip backwards but neither astronaut had serious problems maintaining balance loping became the preferred method of movement the astronauts reported that they needed to plan their movements six or seven steps ahead the fine soil was quite slippery aldrin remarked that moving from sunlight into eagle shadow produced no temperature change inside the suit though the helmet was warmer in sunlight so he felt cooler in shadow the astronauts planted a specially designed us flag on the lunar surface in clear view of the tv camera some time later president richard nixon spoke to them through a telephoneradio transmission which nixon called the most historic phone call ever made from the white house nixon originally had a long speech prepared to read during the phone call but frank borman who was at the white house as a nasa liaison during apollo 11 convinced nixon to keep his words brief to respect the lunar landing as kennedys legacy armstrong thanked the president and gave a brief reflection on the significance of the moment president nixon speaks to armstrong and aldrin on the moon nixon hello neil and buzz im talking to you by telephone from the oval room at the white house and this certainly has to be the most historic telephone call ever made i just cant tell you how proud we all are of what youve done for every american this has to be the proudest day of our lives and for people all over the world i am sure they too join with americans in recognizing what an immense feat this is because of what you have done the heavens have become a part of mans world and as you talk to us from the sea of tranquility it inspires us to redouble our efforts to bring peace and tranquility to earth for one priceless moment in the whole history of man all the people on this earth are truly one one in their pride in what you have done and one in our prayers that you will return safely to earth armstrong thank you mr president its a great honor and privilege for us to be here representing not only the united states but men of peace of all nations and with interest and curiosity and men with a vision for the future its an honor for us to be able to participate here today aldrin bootprint part of an experiment to test the properties of the lunar regolith the mesa failed to provide a stable work platform and was in shadow slowing work somewhat as they worked the moonwalkers kicked up gray dust which soiled the outer part of their suits the integrated thermal meteoroid garment they deployed the easep which included a passive seismograph and a lunar ranging retroreflector lrrr then armstrong walked from the lm to snap photos at the rim of little west crater while aldrin collected two core tubes he used the geological hammer to pound in the tubes the only time the hammer was used on apollo 11 the astronauts then collected rock samples using scoops and tongs on extension handles many of the surface activities took longer than expected so they had to stop documenting sample collection halfway through the allotted 34 minutes map showing landing site and photos taken three new minerals were discovered in the rock samples collected by the astronauts armalcolite tranquillityite and pyroxferroite armalcolite was named after armstrong aldrin and collins during this period mission control used a coded phrase to warn armstrong that his metabolic rates were high and that he should slow down he was moving rapidly from task to task as time ran out however as metabolic rates remained generally lower than expected for both astronauts throughout the walk mission control granted the astronauts a 15minute extension in a 2010 interview armstrong who had walked a maximum of from the lm explained that nasa limited the first moonwalks time and distance because there was no empirical proof of how much cooling water the astronauts plss backpacks would consume to handle their body heat generation while working on the moon lunar ascent and return aldrin next to the passive seismic experiment package with eagle in the background aldrin entered eagle first with some difficulty the astronauts lifted film and two sample boxes containing of lunar surface material to the lm hatch using a flat cable pulley device called the lunar equipment conveyor armstrong reminded aldrin of a bag of memorial items in his suit pocket sleeve and aldrin tossed the bag down armstrong then jumped to the ladders third rung and climbed into the lm after transferring to lm life support the explorers lightened the ascent stage for return to lunar orbit by tossing out their plss backpacks lunar overshoes one hasselblad camera and other equipment they then pressurized the lm and settled down to sleep president nixons speech writer william safire had prepared in event of moon disaster for the president to read on television in the event the apollo 11 astronauts were stranded on the moon the contingency plan originated in a memo from safire to nixons white house chief of staff h r haldeman in which safire suggested a protocol the administration might follow in reaction to such a disaster according to the plan mission control would close down communications with the lm and a clergyman would commend their souls to the deepest of the deep in a public ritual likened to burial at sea the last line of the prepared text contained an allusion to rupert brookes first world war poem the soldier the plan included presidential telephone calls to the astronauts wives while moving within the cabin aldrin accidentally damaged the circuit breaker that would arm the main engine for lift off from the moon there was concern this would prevent firing the engine stranding them on the moon fortunately a felttip pen was sufficient to activate the switch had this not worked the lunar module circuitry could have been reconfigured to allow firing the ascent engine after about seven hours of rest the crew was awakened by houston to prepare for the return flight two and a half hours later at 1754 utc they lifted off in eagle ascent stage to rejoin collins aboard columbia in lunar orbit after more than 21½ total hours on the lunar surface they had left behind scientific instruments that included a retroreflector array used for the lunar laser ranging experiment and a passive seismic experiment package used to measure moonquakes they also left an apollo 1 mission patch and a memorial bag containing a gold replica of an olive branch as a traditional symbol of peace and a silicon message disk the disk carries the goodwill statements by presidents eisenhower kennedy johnson and nixon and messages from leaders of 73 countries around the world the disc also carries a listing of the leadership of the us congress a listing of members of the four committees of the house and senate responsible for the nasa legislation and the names of nasas past and present top management in his 1989 book men from earth aldrin says that the items included soviet medals commemorating cosmonauts vladimir komarov and yuri gagarin also according to deke slaytons book moonshot armstrong carried with him a special diamondstudded astronaut pin from slayton eagle ascent stage approaching columbia film taken from the lm ascent stage upon liftoff from the moon reveals the american flag planted some from the descent stage whipping violently in the exhaust of the ascent stage engine aldrin looked up in time to witness the flag topple the ascent stage of the lm separated i was concentrating on the computers and neil was studying the attitude indicator but i looked up long enough to see the flag fall over subsequent apollo missions usually planted the american flags at least from the lm to prevent them being blown over by the ascent engine exhaust after rendezvous with columbia eagles ascent stage was jettisoned into lunar orbit on july 21 1969 at 2341 utc just before the apollo 12 flight it was noted that eagle was still likely to be orbiting the moon later nasa reports mentioned that eagle orbit had decayed resulting in it impacting in an uncertain location on the lunar surface the location is uncertain because the eagle ascent stage was not tracked after it was jettisoned and the lunar gravity field is sufficiently nonuniform to make the orbit of the spacecraft unpredictable after a short time nasa estimated that the orbit had decayed within months and would have impacted on the moon on july 23 the last night before splashdown the three astronauts made a television broadcast in which collins commented the saturn v rocket which put us in orbit is an incredibly complicated piece of machinery every piece of which worked flawlessly we have always had confidence that this equipment will work properly all this is possible only through the blood sweat and tears of a number of a people all you see is the three of us but beneath the surface are thousands and thousands of others and to all of those i would like to say thank you very much aldrin added this has been far more than three men on a mission to the moon more still than the efforts of a government and industry team more even than the efforts of one nation we feel that this stands as a symbol of the insatiable curiosity of all mankind to explore the unknown personally in reflecting on the events of the past several days a verse from psalms comes to mind when i consider the heavens the work of thy fingers the moon and the stars which thou hast ordained what is man that thou art mindful of him armstrong concluded the responsibility for this flight lies first with history and with the giants of science who have preceded this effort next with the american people who have through their will indicated their desire next with four administrations and their congresses for implementing that will and then with the agency and industry teams that built our spacecraft the saturn the columbia the eagle and the little emu the spacesuit and backpack that was our small spacecraft out on the lunar surface we would like to give special thanks to all those americans who built the spacecraft who did the construction design the tests and put their hearts and all their abilities into those craft to those people tonight we give a special thank you and to all the other people that are listening and watching tonight god bless you good night from apollo 11 on the return to earth a bearing at the guam tracking station failed potentially preventing communication on the last segment of the earth return a regular repair was not possible in the available time but the station director charles force had his tenyearold son greg use his small hands to reach into the housing and pack it with grease greg later was thanked by armstrong splashdown and quarantine columbia floats on the ocean as navy divers assist in retrieving the astronauts the astronauts in their biological isolation garments aboard the on july 24 the astronauts returned home aboard the command module columbia just before dawn local time 1651 utc at in the pacific ocean east of wake island south of johnston atoll and from the recovery ship at 1644 utc the drogue parachutes had been deployed and seven minutes later the command module struck the water forcefully during splashdown the command module landed upside down but was righted within 10 minutes by flotation bags triggered by the astronauts everythings okay our checklist is complete awaiting swimmers was armstrongs last official transmission from the columbia a diver from the navy helicopter hovering above attached a sea anchor to the command module to prevent it from drifting additional divers attached flotation collars to stabilize the module and position rafts for astronaut extraction though the chance of bringing back pathogens from the lunar surface was considered remote it was considered a possibility and nasa took great precautions at the recovery site divers provided the astronauts with biological isolation garments bigs which were worn until they reached isolation facilities on board the hornet additionally astronauts were rubbed down with a sodium hypochlorite solution and the command module wiped with betadine to remove any lunar dust that might be present the raft containing decontamination materials was then intentionally sunk a second sea king helicopter hoisted the astronauts aboard one by one where a nasa flight surgeon gave each a brief physical check during the trip back to the hornet the crew of apollo 11 in quarantine after returning to earth visited by richard nixon after touchdown on the hornet the astronauts exited the helicopter leaving the flight surgeon and three crewmen the helicopter was then lowered into hangar bay 2 where the astronauts walked the to the mobile quarantine facility mqf where they would begin their 21 days of quarantine this practice would continue for two more apollo missions apollo 12 and apollo 14 before the moon was proven to be barren of life and the quarantine process dropped president richard nixon was aboard hornet to personally welcome the astronauts back to earth he told the astronauts as a result of what youve done the world has never been closer together before after nixon departed the hornet was brought alongside the fiveton command module where it was placed aboard by the ships crane placed on a dolly and moved next to the mqf the hornet sailed for pearl harbor where the command module and mqf were airlifted to the manned spacecraft center in accordance with the recently promulgated extraterrestrial exposure law the astronauts were placed in quarantine for fear that the moon might contain undiscovered pathogens and that the astronauts might have been exposed to them during their moon walks however after almost three weeks in confinement first in their trailer and later in the lunar receiving laboratory at the manned spacecraft center the astronauts were given a clean bill of health on august 10 1969 the astronauts exited quarantine celebration parade in new york city on august 13 they rode in parades in their honor in new york chicago and los angeles on the same evening in los angeles there was an official state dinner to celebrate the flight attended by members of congress 44 governors the chief justice of the united states and ambassadors from 83 nations at the century plaza hotel president richard nixon and vice president spiro t agnew honored each astronaut with a presentation of the presidential medal of freedom this celebration was the beginning of a 45day giant leap tour that brought the astronauts to 25 foreign countries and included visits with prominent leaders such as queen elizabeth ii of the united kingdom many nations honored the first manned moon landing with special features in magazines or by issuing apollo 11 commemorative postage stamps or coins on september 16 1969 the three astronauts spoke before a joint session of congress on capitol hill they presented two us flags one to the house of representatives and the other to the senate that had been carried to the surface of the moon with them

reentry1551 6d03h00m splashdown as the first manned spacecraft to orbit more than one celestial body apollo 8s profile had two different sets of orbital parameters separated by a translunar injection maneuver apollo lunar missions would begin with a nominal circular earth parking orbit apollo 8 was launched into an initial orbit with an apogee of and a perigee of with an inclination of 3251 to the equator and an orbital period of 8819 minutes propellant venting increased the apogee by over the 2 hours 44 minutes and 30 seconds spent in the parking orbit this was followed by a translunar injection tli burn of the sivb third stage for 318 seconds accelerating the spacecraft from an orbital velocity of to the injection velocity of which set a record for the highest speed relative to earth that humans had ever traveled this speed was slightly less than the earths escape velocity of but put apollo 8 into an elongated elliptical earth orbit to a point where the moons gravity would capture it the standard lunar orbit for apollo missions was planned as a nominal circular orbit above the moons surface initial lunar orbit insertion was an ellipse with a perilune of and an apolune of at an inclination of 12 from the lunar equator this was then circularized at by with an orbital period of 1287 minutes the effect of lunar mass concentrations masscons on the orbit was found to be greater than initially predicted over the course of the twentyhour mission the orbit was perturbated to by apollo 8 achieved a maximum distance from earth of launch and translunar injection double exposure of the moon which was not visible at the time apollo 8 launched at 75100 am eastern standard time on december 21 1968 using the saturn vs three stages to achieve earth orbit the sic first stage impacted the atlantic ocean at and the sii second stage at the sivb third stage injected the craft into earth orbit but remained attached to later perform the translunar injection tli burn that put the spacecraft on a trajectory to the moon the titan ii launch vehicle used for the gemini program had been notoriously roughriding and technicians promised the astronauts that the saturn v which was designed for the apollo program rather than adapted from a missile would have a much smoother ride lovell and borman both gemini veterans found this promise did not disappoint during liftoff they reported feeling nothing but a dull muted rumble in the distance once the vehicle reached earth orbit both the crew and houston flight controllers spent the next 2 hours and 38 minutes checking that the spacecraft was in proper working order and ready for tli the proper operation of the sivb third stage of the rocket was crucial in the last unmanned test it had failed to reignite for tli during the flight three fellow astronauts served on the ground as capsule communicators usually referred to as capcoms on a rotating schedule the capcoms were the only people who regularly communicated with the crew michael collins was the first capcom on duty and at 2 hours 27 minutes and 22 seconds after launch radioed apollo 8 you are go for tli this communication signified that mission control had given official permission for apollo 8 to go to the moon over the next 12 minutes before the tli burn the apollo 8 crew continued to monitor the spacecraft and the sivb the engine ignited on time and performed the tli burn perfectly after the sivb had performed its required tasks it was jettisoned the crew then rotated the spacecraft to take some photographs of the spent stage and then practiced flying in formation with it as the crew rotated the spacecraft they had their first views of the earth as they moved away from it this marked the first time humans could view the whole earth at once borman became worried that the sivb was staying too close to the commandservice module and suggested to mission control that the crew perform a separation maneuver mission control first suggested pointing the spacecraft towards earth and using the reaction control system rcs thrusters on the service module sm to add away from the earth but borman did not want to lose sight of the sivb after discussion the crew and mission control decided to burn in this direction but at instead these discussions put the crew an hour behind their flight plan apollo 8 sivb rocket stage shortly after separation five hours after launch mission control sent a command to the sivb booster to vent its remaining fuel through its engine bell to change the boosters trajectory this sivb would then pass the moon and enter into a solar orbit posing no further hazard to apollo 8 the sivb subsequently went into a solar orbit with an inclination of 2347 from the plane of the ecliptic and an orbital period of 34080 days after the insertion into translunar orbit the saturn ivb third stage became a derelict object it will continue to orbit the sun for many years the apollo 8 crew were the first humans to pass through the van allen radiation belts which extend up to from earth scientists predicted that passing through the belts quickly at the spacecrafts high speed would cause a radiation dosage of no more than a chest xray or 1 milligray during a year the average human receives a dose of 2 to 3 mgy to record the actual radiation dosages each crew member wore a personal radiation dosimeter that transmitted data to earth as well as three passive film dosimeters that showed the cumulative radiation experienced by the crew by the end of the mission the crew experienced an average radiation dose of 16 mgy lunar trajectory the first image ever taken by humans of the whole earth probably photographed by william anders south is up with south america in the middle jim lovells main job as command module pilot was as navigator although mission control performed all the actual navigation calculations it was necessary to have a crew member serving as navigator so that the crew could return to earth in case of loss of communication with mission control lovell navigated by star sightings using a sextant built into the spacecraft measuring the angle between a star and the earths or the moons horizon this task was difficult because a large cloud of debris around the spacecraft formed by the venting sivb made it hard to distinguish the stars by seven hours into the mission the crew was about one hour and 40 minutes behind flight plan because of the problems in moving away from the sivb and lovells obscured star sightings the crew now placed the spacecraft into passive thermal control ptc also called barbecue roll in which the spacecraft rotated about once per hour around its long axis to ensure even heat distribution across the surface of the spacecraft in direct sunlight the spacecraft could be heated to over while the parts in shadow would be these temperatures could cause the heat shield to crack and propellant lines to burst because it was impossible to get a perfect roll the spacecraft swept out a cone as it rotated the crew had to make minor adjustments every half hour as the cone pattern got larger and larger the first midcourse correction came 11 hours into the flight testing on the ground had shown that the service propulsion system sps engine had a small chance of exploding when burned for long periods unless its combustion chamber was coated first burning the engine for a short period would accomplish coating this first correction burn was only 24 seconds and added about velocity prograde in the direction of travel this change was less than the planned because of a bubble of helium in the oxidizer lines which caused unexpectedly low propellant pressure the crew had to use the small rcs thrusters to make up the shortfall two later planned midcourse corrections were canceled because the apollo 8 trajectory was found to be perfect eleven hours into the flight the crew had been awake for more than 16 hours before launch nasa had decided that at least one crew member should be awake at all times to deal with problems that might arise borman started the first sleep shift but found sleeping difficult because of the constant radio chatter and mechanical noises about an hour after starting his sleep shift borman obtained permission from ground control to take a seconal sleeping pill the pill had little effect borman eventually fell asleep and then awoke feeling ill he vomited twice and had a bout of diarrhea this left the spacecraft full of small globules of vomit and feces which the crew cleaned up as well as they could borman initially did not want everyone to know about his medical problems but lovell and anders wanted to inform mission control the crew decided to use the data storage equipment dse which could tape voice recordings and telemetry and dump them to mission control at high speed after recording a description of bormans illness they asked mission control to check the recording stating that they would like an evaluation of the voice comments the apollo 8 crew and mission control medical personnel held a conference using an unoccupied secondfloor control room there were two identical control rooms in houston on the second and third floors only one of which was used during a mission the conference participants concluded that there was little to worry about and that bormans illness was either a 24hour flu as borman thought or a reaction to the sleeping pill researchers now believe that he was suffering from spaceadaptation syndrome which affects about a third of astronauts during their first day in space as their vestibular system adapts to weightlessness spaceadaptation syndrome had not occurred on previous spacecraft mercury and gemini because those astronauts couldnt move freely in the small cabins of those spacecraft the increased cabin space in the apollo command module afforded astronauts greater freedom of movement contributing to symptoms of space sickness for borman and later astronaut russell schweickart during apollo 9 film of the crew taken while they were in orbit around the moon frank borman is in the center the cruise phase was a relatively uneventful part of the flight except for the crew checking that the spacecraft was in working order and that they were on course during this time nasa scheduled a television broadcast at 31 hours after launch the apollo 8 crew used a 2 kg camera that broadcast in blackandwhite only using a vidicon tube the camera had two lenses a very wideangle 160 lens and a telephoto 9 lens during this first broadcast the crew gave a tour of the spacecraft and attempted to show how the earth appeared from space however difficulties aiming the narrowangle lens without the aid of a monitor to show what it was looking at made showing the earth impossible additionally the earth image became saturated by any bright source without proper filters in the end all the crew could show the people watching back on earth was a bright blob after broadcasting for 17 minutes the rotation of the spacecraft took the highgain antenna out of view of the receiving stations on earth and they ended the transmission with lovell wishing his mother a happy birthday by this time the crew had completely abandoned the planned sleep shifts lovell went to sleep 32½ hours into the flight3½ hours before he had planned to a short while later anders also went to sleep after taking a sleeping pill the crew was unable to see the moon for much of the outward cruise two factors made the moon almost impossible to see from inside the spacecraft three of the five windows fogging up due to outgassed oils from the silicone sealant and the attitude required for the ptc it was not until the crew had gone behind the moon that they would be able to see it for the first time apollo 8 made a second television broadcast at 55 hours into the flight this time the crew rigged up filters meant for the still cameras so they could acquire images of the earth through the telephoto lens although difficult to aim as they had to maneuver the entire spacecraft the crew was able to broadcast back to earth the first television pictures of the earth the crew spent the transmission describing the earth and what was visible and the colors they could see the transmission lasted 23 minutes lunar sphere of influence at about 55 hours and 40 minutes into the flight the crew of apollo 8 became the first humans to enter the gravitational sphere of influence of another celestial body in other words the effect of the moons gravitational force on apollo 8 became stronger than that of the earth at the time it happened apollo 8 was from the moon and had a speed of relative to the moon this historic moment was of little interest to the crew since they were still calculating their trajectory with respect to the launch pad at kennedy space center they would continue to do so until they performed their last midcourse correction switching to a reference frame based on ideal orientation for the second engine burn they would make in lunar orbit it was only 13 hours until they would be in lunar orbit the last major event before lunar orbit insertion loi was a second midcourse correction it was in retrograde against direction of travel and slowed the spacecraft down by effectively lowering the closest distance that the spacecraft would pass the moon at exactly 61 hours after launch about from the moon the crew burned the rcs for 11 seconds they would now pass from the lunar surface at 64 hours into the flight the crew began to prepare for lunar orbit insertion1 loi1 this maneuver had to be performed perfectly and due to orbital mechanics had to be on the far side of the moon out of contact with the earth after mission control was polled for a gono go decision the crew was told at 68 hours they were go and riding the best bird we can find lovell replied well see you on the other side and for the first time in history humans travelled behind the moon and out of radio contact with the earth with 10 minutes before the loi1 the crew began one last check of the spacecraft systems and made sure that every switch was in the correct place at that time they finally got their first glimpses of the moon they had been flying over the unlit side and it was lovell who saw the first shafts of sunlight obliquely illuminating the lunar surface the loi burn was only two minutes away so the crew had little time to appreciate the view lunar orbit the sps ignited at 69 hours 8 minutes and 16 seconds after launch and burned for 4 minutes and 7 seconds placing the apollo 8 spacecraft in orbit around the moon the crew described the burn as being the longest four minutes of their lives if the burn had not lasted exactly the correct amount of time the spacecraft could have ended up in a highly elliptical lunar orbit or even flung off into space if it lasted too long they could have struck the moon after making sure the spacecraft was working they finally had a chance to look at the moon which they would orbit for the next 20 hours on earth mission control continued to wait if the crew had not burned the engine or the burn had not lasted the planned length of time the crew would appear early from behind the moon however this time came and went without apollo 8 reappearing exactly at the calculated moment the signal was received from the spacecraft indicating it was in a orbit about the moon after reporting on the status of the spacecraft lovell gave the first description of what the lunar surface looked like lunar far side as seen from apollo 8 lovell continued to describe the terrain they were passing over one of the crews major tasks was reconnaissance of planned future landing sites on the moon especially one in mare tranquillitatis that would be the apollo 11 landing site the launch time of apollo 8 had been chosen to give the best lighting conditions for examining the site a film camera had been set up in one of the spacecraft windows to record a frame every second of the moon below bill anders spent much of the next 20 hours taking as many photographs as possible of targets of interest by the end of the mission the crew had taken 700 photographs of the moon and 150 of the earth throughout the hour that the spacecraft was in contact with earth borman kept asking how the data for the sps looked he wanted to make sure that the engine was working and could be used to return early to the earth if necessary he also asked that they receive a gono go decision before they passed behind the moon on each orbit as they reappeared for their second pass in front of the moon the crew set up the equipment to broadcast a view of the lunar surface anders described the craters that they were passing over at the end of this second orbit they performed the 11second loi2 burn of the sps to circularize the orbit to through the next two orbits the crew continued to keep check of the spacecraft and to observe and photograph the moon during the third pass borman read a small prayer for his church he had been scheduled to participate in a service at st christophers episcopal church near seabrook texas but due to the apollo 8 flight he was unable to a fellow parishioner and engineer at mission control rod rose suggested that borman read the prayer which could be recorded and then replayed during the service earthrise when the spacecraft came out from behind the moon for its fourth pass across the front the crew witnessed earthrise for the first time in human history nasas lunar orbiter 1 took the very first picture of an earthrise from the vicinity of the moon on august 23 1966 borman saw the earth emerging from behind the lunar horizon and then called in excitement to the others taking a blackandwhite photograph as he did so in the ensuing scramble anders took earthrise a more famous color photo later picked by life magazine as one of its hundred photos of the century due to the synchronous rotation of the moon about the earth earthrise is not generally visible from the lunar surface earthrise is generally only visible when orbiting the moon other than at selected places near the moons limb where libration carries the earth slightly above and below the lunar horizon anders continued to take photographs while lovell assumed control of the spacecraft so borman could rest despite the difficulty resting in the cramped and noisy spacecraft borman was able to sleep for two orbits awakening periodically to ask questions about their status borman awoke fully however when he started to hear his fellow crew members make mistakes they were beginning to not understand questions and would have to ask for the answers to be repeated borman realized that everyone was extremely tired from not having a good nights sleep in over three days he ordered anders and lovell to get some sleep and that the rest of the flight plan regarding observing the moon be scrubbed at first anders protested saying that he was fine but borman would not be swayed at last anders agreed as long as borman would set up the camera to continue to take automatic shots of the moon borman also remembered that there was a second television broadcast planned and with so many people expected to be watching he wanted the crew to be alert for the next two orbits anders and lovell slept while borman sat at the helm on subsequent apollo missions crews would avoid this situation by sleeping on the same schedule the apollo 8 genesis reading as they rounded the moon for the ninth time the second television transmission began borman introduced the crew followed by each man giving his impression of the lunar surface and what it was like to be orbiting the moon borman described it as being a vast lonely forbidding expanse of nothing then after talking about what they were flying over anders said that the crew had a message for all those on earth each man on board read a section from the biblical creation story from the book of genesis borman finished the broadcast by wishing a merry christmas to everyone on earth his message appeared to sum up the feelings that all three crewmen had from their vantage point in lunar orbit borman said and from the crew of apollo 8 we close with good night good luck a merry christmas and god bless all of youall of you on the good earth the only task left for the crew at this point was to perform the transearth injection tei which was scheduled for 2½ hours after the end of the television transmission the tei was the most critical burn of the flight as any failure of the sps to ignite would strand the crew in lunar orbit with little hope of escape as with the previous burn the crew had to perform the maneuver above the far side of the moon out of contact with earth the burn occurred exactly on time the spacecraft telemetry was reacquired as it reemerged from behind the moon at 89 hours 28 minutes and 39 seconds the exact time calculated when voice contact was regained lovell announced please be informed there is a santa claus to which ken mattingly the current capcom replied thats affirmative you are the best ones to know the spacecraft began its journey back to earth on december 25 christmas day unplanned manual realignment later lovell used some otherwise idle time to do some navigational sightings maneuvering the module to view various stars by using the computer keyboard however he accidentally erased some of the computers memory which caused the inertial measurement unit imu to think the module was in the same relative position it had been in before liftoff and fire the thrusters to correct the modules attitude once the crew realized why the computer had changed the modules attitude they realized they would have to reenter data that would tell the computer its real position it took lovell ten minutes to figure out the right numbers using the thrusters to get the stars rigel and sirius aligned and another 15 minutes to enter the corrected data into the computer sixteen months later lovell would once again have to perform a similar manual realignment under more critical conditions during the apollo 13 mission after that modules imu had to be turned off to conserve energy in his 1994 book lost moon the perilous voyage of apollo 13 lovell wrote my training on apollo 8 came in handy in that book he dismissed the incident as a planned experiment requested by the ground crew in subsequent interviews lovell has acknowledged that the incident was an accident caused by his mistake cruise back to earth and reentry reentry december 27 1968 photographed from a kc135 at 40000 feet the cruise back to earth was mostly a time for the crew to relax and monitor the spacecraft as long as the trajectory specialists had calculated everything correctly the spacecraft would reenter twoandhalf days after tei and splashdown in the pacific on christmas afternoon the crew made their fifth television broadcast this time they gave a tour of the spacecraft showing how an astronaut lived in space when they finished broadcasting they found a small present from deke slayton in the food locker a real turkey dinner with stuffing in the same kind of pack that the troops in vietnam received another slayton surprise was a gift of three miniature bottles of brandy that borman ordered the crew to leave alone until after they landed they remained unopened even years after the flight there were also small presents to the crew from their wives the next day at about 124 hours into the mission the sixth and final tv transmission showed the missions best video images of the earth in a fourminute broadcast command module on the deck of after two uneventful days the crew prepared for reentry the computer would control the reentry and all the crew had to do was put the spacecraft in the correct attitude blunt end forward if the computer broke down borman would take over once the command module was separated from the service module the astronauts were committed to reentry six minutes before they hit the top of the atmosphere the crew saw the moon rising above the earths horizon just as had been predicted by the trajectory specialists as they hit the thin outer atmosphere they noticed it was becoming hazy outside as glowing plasma formed around the spacecraft the spacecraft started slowing down and the deceleration peaked at 6 g 59 ms2 with the computer controlling the descent by changing the attitude of the spacecraft apollo 8 rose briefly like a skipping stone before descending to the ocean at the drogue parachute stabilized the spacecraft and was followed at by the three main parachutes the spacecraft splashdown position was officially reported as in the north pacific ocean south of hawaii when it hit the water the parachutes dragged the spacecraft over and left it upside down in what was termed stable 2 position about six minutes later the command module was righted into its normal apexup splashdown orientation by the inflatable bag uprighting system as they were buffeted by a swell borman

57,apollo 8 came at the end of 1968 a year that had seen much upheaval in the united states and most of the world even though the year saw political assassinations political unrest in the streets of europe and america and the prague spring time magazine chose the crew of apollo 8 as its men of the year for 1968 recognizing them as the people who most influenced events in the preceding year they had been the first people ever to leave the gravitational influence of the earth and orbit another celestial body they had survived a mission that even the crew themselves had rated as only having a fiftyfifty chance of fully succeeding the effect of apollo 8 can be summed up by a telegram from a stranger received by borman after the mission that simply stated thank you apollo 8 you saved 1968 one of the most famous aspects of the flight was the earthrise picture that was taken as they came around for their fourth orbit of the moon this was the first time that humans had taken such a picture whilst actually behind the camera and it has been credited with a role in inspiring the first earth day in 1970 it was selected as the first of life magazines 100 photographs that changed the world apollo 11 astronaut michael collins said eights momentous historic significance was foremost while many space historians such as robert k poole see apollo 8 as the most historically significant of all the apollo missions the mission was the most widely covered by the media since the first american orbital flight mercuryatlas 6 by john glenn in 1962 there were 1200 journalists covering the mission with the bbc coverage being broadcast in 54 countries in 15 different languages the soviet newspaper pravda featured a quote from boris nikolaevich petrov chairman of the soviet interkosmos program who described the flight as an outstanding achievement of american space sciences and technology it is estimated that a quarter of the people alive at the time saweither live or delayedthe christmas eve transmission during the ninth orbit of the moon the apollo 8 broadcasts won an emmy award the highest honor given by the academy of television arts sciences apollo 8 commemorative stampmadalyn murray ohair an atheist later caused controversy by bringing a lawsuit against nasa over the reading from genesis ohair wished the courts to ban american astronautswho were all government employeesfrom public prayer in space though the case was rejected by the supreme court of the united states for lack of jurisdiction it caused nasa to be skittish about the issue of religion throughout the rest of the apollo program buzz aldrin on apollo 11 selfcommunicated presbyterian communion on the surface of the moon after landing he refrained from mentioning this publicly for several years and only obliquely referred to it at the time in 1969 the united states postal service issued a postage stamp scott catalogue 1371 commemorating the apollo 8 flight around the moon the stamp featured a detail of the famous photograph of the earthrise over the moon taken by anders on christmas eve and the words in the beginning god just 18 days after the crews return to earth they were featured during the 1969 super bowl pregame show reciting the pledge of allegiance prior to the national anthem being performed by anita bryant

58,in 1959 when both the united states and soviet union were planning but had yet to launch humans into space nasa administrator t keith glennan and his deputy administrator dr hugh dryden discussed whether spacecraft crew members should be called astronauts or cosmonauts dryden preferred cosmonaut on the grounds that flights would occur in the cosmos near space while the astro prefix suggested flight to the stars most nasa space task group members preferred astronaut which survived by common usage as the preferred american term when the soviet union launched the first man into space yuri gagarin in 1961 they chose a term which anglicizes to cosmonaut english in englishspeaking nations a professional space traveler is called an astronaut the term derives from the greek words ástron ἄστρον meaning star and nautes ναύτης meaning sailor the first known use of the term astronaut in the modern sense was by neil r jones in his short story the deaths head meteor in 1930 the word itself had been known earlier for example in percy gregs 1880 book across the zodiac astronaut referred to a spacecraft in les navigateurs de linfini 1925 of jh rosny aîné the word astronautique astronautic was used the word may have been inspired by aeronaut an older term for an air traveler first applied in 1784 to balloonists an early use in a nonfiction publication is eric frank russells poem the astronaut in the november 1934 bulletin of the british interplanetary society the first known formal use of the term astronautics in the scientific community was the establishment of the annual international astronautical congress in 1950 and the subsequent founding of the international astronautical federation the following year nasa applies the term astronaut to any crew member aboard nasa spacecraft bound for earth orbit or beyond nasa also uses the term as a title for those selected to join its astronaut corps the european space agency similarly uses the term astronaut for members of its astronaut corps russian by convention an astronaut employed by the russian federal space agency or its soviet predecessor is called a cosmonaut in english texts the word is an anglicisation of the russian word kosmonavt one who works in space outside the earths atmosphere a space traveler which derives from the greek words kosmos κόσμος meaning universe and nautes ναύτης meaning sailor other countries of the former eastern bloc use variations of the russian word kosmonavt such as the polish kosmonauta coinage of the term kosmonavt has been credited to soviet aeronautics pioneer mikhail tikhonravov 19001974 the first cosmonaut was soviet air force pilot yuri gagarin also the first person in space valentina tereshkova a russian factory worker was the first woman in space as well as the first civilian among the soviet cosmonaut or nasa astronaut corps to make a spaceflight on march 14 1995 norman thagard became the first american to ride to space on board a russian launch vehicle and thus became the first american cosmonaut chinese official englishlanguage texts issued by the government of china use astronaut while texts in russian use космонавт cosmonaut in official chineselanguage texts yǔ háng yuán space navigating personnel is used for astronauts and cosmonauts and háng tiān yuán space navigating personnel is used for chinese astronauts the phrase tài kōng rén spaceman is often used in hong kong and taiwan the term taikonaut is used by some englishlanguage news media organizations for professional space travelers from china the word has featured in the longman and oxford english dictionaries the latter of which describes it as a hybrid of the chinese term taikong space and the greek naut sailor the term became more common in 2003 when china sent its first astronaut yang liwei into space aboard the shenzhou 5 spacecraft this is the term used by xinhua news agency in the english version of the chinese peoples daily since the advent of the chinese space program the origin of the term is unclear as early as may 1998 chiew lee yih from malaysia used it in newsgroups other terms with the rise of space tourism nasa and the russian federal space agency agreed to use the term spaceflight participant to distinguish those space travelers from professional astronauts on missions coordinated by those two agencies while no nation other than the russian federation and previously the former soviet union the united states and china have launched a manned spacecraft several other nations have sent people into space in cooperation with one of these countries inspired partly by these missions other synonyms for astronaut have entered occasional english usage for example the term spationaut french spelling spationaute is sometimes used to describe french space travelers from the latin word spatium for space the malay term angkasawan was used to describe participants in the angkasawan program and the indian space research organisation

59,charles k smith argues that swifts rhetorical style persuades the reader to detest the speaker and pity the irish swifts specific strategy is twofold using a trap to create sympathy for the irish and a dislike of the narrator who in the span of one sentence details vividly and with rhetorical emphasis the grinding poverty but feels emotion solely for members of his own class swifts use of gripping details of poverty and his narrators cool approach towards them create two opposing points of view that alienate the reader perhaps unconsciously from a narrator who can view with melancholy detachment a subject that swift has directed us rhetorically to see in a much less detached way swift has his proposer further degrade the irish by using language ordinarily reserved for animals lewis argues that the speaker uses the vocabulary of animal husbandry to describe the irish once the children have been commodified swifts rhetoric can easily turn people into animals then meat and from meat logically into tonnage worth a price per pound swift uses the proposers serious tone to highlight the absurdity of his proposal in making his argument the speaker uses the conventional textbookapproved order of argument from swifts time which was derived from the latin rhetorician quintilian the contrast between the careful control against the almost inconceivable perversion of his scheme and the ridiculousness of the proposal create a situation in which the reader has to consider just what perverted values and assumptions would allow such a diligent thoughtful and conventional man to propose so perverse a plan
59,swift goes to great lengths to support his argument including a list of possible preparation styles for the children and calculations showing the financial benefits of his suggestion he uses methods of argument throughout his essay which lampoon the theninfluential william petty and the social engineering popular among followers of francis bacon these lampoons include appealing to the authority of a very knowing american of my acquaintance in london and the famous psalmanazar a native of the island formosa who had already confessed to not being from formosa in 1706 this essay is widely held to be one of the greatest examples of sustained irony in the history of the english language much of its shock value derives from the fact that the first portion of the essay describes the plight of starving beggars in ireland so that the reader is unprepared for the surprise of swifts solution when he states a young healthy child well nursed is at a year old a most delicious nourishing and wholesome food whether stewed roasted baked or boiled and i make no doubt that it will equally serve in a fricassee or a ragout in the tradition of roman satire swift introduces the reforms he is actually suggesting by paralipsis

59,scholars have speculated about which earlier works swift may have had in mind when he wrote a modest proposal tertullians apology james johnson argued that a modest proposal was largely influenced and inspired by tertullians apology a satirical attack against early roman persecution of christianity james william johnson believes that swift saw major similarities between the two situations johnson notes swifts obvious affinity for tertullian and the bold stylistic and structural similarities between the works a modest proposal and apology in structure johnson points out the same central theme that of cannibalism and the eating of babies as well as the same final argument that human depravity is such that men will attempt to justify their own cruelty by accusing their victims of being lower than human stylistically swift and tertullian share the same command of sarcasm and language in agreement with johnson donald c baker points out the similarity between both authors tones and use of irony baker notes the uncanny way that both authors imply an ironic justification by ownership over the subject of sacrificing childrentertullian while attacking pagan parents and swift while attacking the english mistreatment of the irish poor defoes the generous projector it has also been argued that a modest proposal was at least in part a response to the 1728 essay the generous projector or a friendly proposal to prevent murder and other enormous abuses by erecting an hospital for foundlings and bastard children by swifts rival daniel defoe mandevilles modest defence of publick stews bernard mandevilles modest defence of publick stews asked to introduce public and state controlled bordellos the 1726 paper acknowledges womens interests andwhile not being a complete satirical texthas been discussed as well as an inspiration for jonathan swifts title mandeville had become famous with the fable of the bees and deliberations on private vices and public benefits in 1705 already john locke from the first treatise of government be it then as sir robert says that anciently it was usual for men to sell and castrate their children let it be that they exposed them add to it if you please for this is still greater power that they begat them for their tables to fat and eat them if this proves a right to do so we may by the same argument justifie adultery incest and sodomy for there are examples of these too both ancient and modern sins which i suppose have the principle aggravation from this that they cross the main intention of nature which willeth the increase of mankind and the continuation of the species in the highest perfection and the distinction of families with the security of the marriage bed as necessary thereunto first treatise sec 59
59,a modest proposal is included in many literature programs as an example of early modern western satire it also serves as an exceptional introduction to the concept and use of argumentative language lending itself well to secondary and postsecondary essay courses outside of the realm of english studies a modest proposal is a relevant piece included in many comparative and global literature and history courses as well as those of numerous other disciplines in the arts humanities and even the social sciences the essay has been emulated many times in his book a modest proposal 1984 evangelical author frank schaeffer emulated swifts work in social conservative polemic against abortion and euthanasia in a future dystopia that advocated recycling of aborted embryos and fetuses as well as some disabled infants with compound intellectual physical and physiological difficulties such baby doe rules cases were then a major concern of the prolife movement of the early 1980s which viewed selective treatment of those infants as disability discrimination in his book a modest proposal for america 2013 statistician howard friedman opens with a satirical reflection of the extreme drive to fiscal stability by ultraconservatives a modest video game proposal is the title of an open letter sent by activistformer attorney jack thompson on october 10 2005 he proposed that if someone could create manufacture distribute and sell a video game in 2006 that allows players to play the scenario he has written in which the character kills video game developersa modest video game proposalcite notemodestproposal11 hunter s thompsons fear and loathing in america the brutal odyssey of an outlaw journalist which contains hundreds of private letters written by thompson over the years contains a letter in which he uses a modest proposals satire technique against the vietnam war thompson writes a letter to a local aspen newspaper informing them that on christmas eve he was going to use napalm to burn a number of dogs and hopefully any humans they find this letter protests against the burning of vietnamese people occurring overseas the 2012 film butcher boys written by the texas chain saw massacre coscribe kim henkel is said to be loosely based on jonathan swifts a modest proposal the films opening scene takes place in a restaurant named j swifts
59,robert phiddians article have you eaten yet the reader in a modest proposal focuses on two aspects of a modest proposal the voice of swift and the voice of the proposer phiddian stresses that a reader of the pamphlet must learn to distinguish between the satiric voice of jonathan swift and the apparent economic projections of the proposer he reminds readers that there is a gap between the narrators meaning and the texts and that a moralpolitical argument is being carried out by means of parody while swifts proposal is obviously not a serious economic proposal george wittkowsky author of swifts modest proposal the biography of an early georgian pamphlet argues that to understand the piece fully it is important to understand the economics of swifts time wittowsky argues that not enough critics have taken the time to focus directly on the mercantilism and theories of labour in 18th century england if one regards the modest proposal simply as a criticism of condition about all one can say is that conditions were bad and that swifts irony brilliantly underscored this fact people are the riches of a nation at the start of a new industrial age in the 18th century it was believed that people are the riches of the nation and there was a general faith in an economy that paid its workers low wages because high wages meant workers would work less furthermore in the mercantilist view no child was too young to go into industry in those times the somewhat more humane attitudes of an earlier day had all but disappeared and the laborer had come to be regarded as a commodity louis a landa presents swifts a modest proposal as a critique of the popular and unjustified maxim of mercantilism in the 18th century that people are the riches of a nation swift presents the dire state of ireland and shows that mere population itself in irelands case did not always mean greater wealth and economy the uncontrolled maxim fails to take into account that a person who does not produce in an economic or political way makes a country poorer not richer swift also recognises the implications of such a fact in making mercantilist philosophy a paradox the wealth of a country is based on the poverty of the majority of its citizens swift however landa argues is not merely criticising economic maxims but also addressing the fact that england was denying irish citizens their natural rights and dehumanising them by viewing them as a mere commodity
59,george wittkowsky argued that swifts main target in a modest proposal was not the conditions in ireland but rather the cando spirit of the times that led people to devise a number of illogical schemes that would purportedly solve social and economic ills swift was especially insulted by projects that tried to fix population and labour issues with a simple cureall solution a memorable example of these sorts of schemes involved the idea of running the poor through a jointstock company in response swifts modest proposal was a burlesque of projects concerning the poor that were in vogue during the early 18th century a modest proposal also targets the calculating way people perceived the poor in designing their projects the pamphlet targets reformers who regard people as commodities in the piece swift adopts the technique of a political arithmetician to show the utter ridiculousness of trying to prove any proposal with dispassionate statistics critics differ about swifts intentions in using this fauxmathematical philosophy edmund wilson argues that statistically the logic of the modest proposal can be compared with defense of crime arrogated to marx in which he argues that crime takes care of the superfluous population wittkowsky counters that swifts satiric use of statistical analysis is an effort to enhance his satire that springs from a spirit of bitter mockery not from the delight in calculations for their own sake
60,metals pure alkali metals are dangerously reactive with air and water and must be kept away from heat fire oxidising agents acids most organic compounds halocarbons plastics and moisture they also react with carbon dioxide and carbon tetrachloride so that normal fire extinguishers are counterproductive when used on alkali metal fires some class d dry powder extinguishers designed for metal fires are effective depriving the fire of oxygen and cooling the alkali metal experiments are usually conducted using only small quantities of a few grams in a fume hood small quantities of lithium may be disposed of by reaction with cool water but the heavier alkali metals should be dissolved in the less reactive isopropanol the alkali metals must be stored under mineral oil or an inert atmosphere the inert atmosphere used may be argon or nitrogen gas except for lithium which reacts with nitrogen rubidium and caesium must be kept away from air even under oil because even a small amount of air diffused into the oil may trigger formation of the dangerously explosive peroxide for the same reason potassium should not be stored under oil in an oxygencontaining atmosphere for longer than 6 months ions lithium carbonate the bioinorganic chemistry of the alkali metal ions has been extensively reviewed solid state crystal structures have been determined for many complexes of alkali metal ions in small peptides nucleic acid constituents carbohydrates and ionophore complexes lithium naturally only occurs in traces in biological systems and has no known biological role but does have effects on the body when ingested lithium carbonate is used as a mood stabiliser in psychiatry to treat bipolar disorder manicdepression in daily doses of about 05 to 2 grams although there are sideeffects excessive ingestion of lithium causes drowsiness slurred speech and vomiting among other symptoms and poisons the central nervous system which is dangerous as the required dosage of lithium to treat bipolar disorder is only slightly lower than the toxic dosage its biochemistry the way it is handled by the human body and studies using rats and goats suggest that it is an essential trace element although the natural biological function of lithium in humans has yet to be identified sodium and potassium occur in all known biological systems generally functioning as electrolytes inside and outside cells sodium is an essential nutrient that regulates blood volume blood pressure osmotic equilibrium and ph the minimum physiological requirement for sodium is 500 milligrams per day sodium chloride also known as common salt is the principal source of sodium in the diet and is used as seasoning and preservative such as for pickling and jerky most of it comes from processed foods the dietary reference intake for sodium is 15 grams per day but most people in the united states consume more than 23 grams per day the minimum amount that promotes hypertension this in turn causes 76 million premature deaths worldwide potassium is the major cation positive ion inside animal cells while sodium is the major cation outside animal cells the concentration differences of these charged particles causes a difference in electric potential between the inside and outside of cells known as the membrane potential the balance between potassium and sodium is maintained by ion transporter proteins in the cell membrane the cell membrane potential created by potassium and sodium ions allows the cell to generate an action potentiala spike of electrical discharge the ability of cells to produce electrical discharge is critical for body functions such as neurotransmission muscle contraction and heart function disruption of this balance may thus be fatal for example ingestion of large amounts of potassium compounds can lead to hyperkalemia strongly influencing the cardiovascular system potassium chloride is used in the united states for lethal injection executions a wheel type radiotherapy device which has a long collimator to focus the radiation into a narrow beam the caesium137 chloride radioactive source is the blue square and gamma rays are represented by the beam emerging from the aperture this was the radiation source involved in the goiânia accident containing about 93 grams of caesium137 chloride due to their similar atomic radii rubidium and caesium in the body mimic potassium and are taken up similarly rubidium has no known biological role but may help stimulate metabolism and similarly to caesium replace potassium in the body causing potassium deficiency partial substitution is quite possible and rather nontoxic a 70 kg person contains on average 036 g of rubidium and an increase in this value by 50 to 100 times did not show negative effects in test persons rats can survive up to 50 substitution of potassium by rubidium rubidium and to a much lesser extent caesium can function as temporary cures for hypokalemia while rubidium can adequately physiologically substitute potassium in some systems caesium is never able to do so there is only very limited evidence in the form of deficiency symptoms for rubidium being possibly essential in goats even if this is true the trace amounts usually present in food are more than enough caesium compounds are rarely encountered by most people but most caesium compounds are mildly toxic like rubidium caesium tends to substitute potassium in the body but is significantly larger and is therefore a poorer substitute excess caesium can lead to hypokalemia arrythmia and acute cardiac arrest but such amounts would not ordinarily be encountered in natural sources as such caesium is not a major chemical environmental pollutant the median lethal dose ld50 value for caesium chloride in mice is 23 g per kilogram which is comparable to the ld50 values of potassium chloride and sodium chloride caesium chloride has been promoted as an alternative cancer therapy but has been linked to the deaths of over 50 patients on whom it was used as part of a scientifically unvalidated cancer treatment radioisotopes of caesium require special precautions the improper handling of caesium137 gamma ray sources can lead to release of this radioisotope and radiation injuries perhaps the bestknown case is the goiânia accident of 1987 in which an improperlydisposedof radiation therapy system from an abandoned clinic in the city of goiânia brazil was scavenged from a junkyard and the glowing caesium salt sold to curious uneducated buyers this led to four deaths and serious injuries from radiation exposure together with caesium134 iodine131 and strontium90 caesium137 was among the isotopes distributed by the chernobyl disaster which constitute the greatest risk to health radioisotopes of francium would presumably be dangerous as well due to their high decay energy and short halflife but none have been produced in large enough amounts to pose any serious risk
60,physical and chemical the physical and chemical properties of the alkali metals can be readily explained by their having an ns1 valence electron configuration which results in weak metallic bonding hence all the alkali metals are soft and have low densities melting and boiling points as well as heats of sublimation vaporisation and dissociation they all crystallise in the bodycentered cubic crystal structure and have distinctive flame colours because their outer s electron is very easily excited the ns1 configuration also results in the alkali metals having very large atomic and ionic radii as well as very high thermal and electrical conductivity their chemistry is dominated by the loss of their lone valence electron in the outermost sorbital to form the 1 oxidation state due to the ease of ionising this electron and the very high second ionisation energy most of the chemistry has been observed only for the first five members of the group the chemistry of francium is not well established due to its extreme radioactivity thus the presentation of its properties here is limited what little is known about francium shows that it is very close in behaviour to caesium as expected the physical properties of francium are even sketchier because the bulk element has never been observed hence any data that may be found in the literature are certainly speculative extrapolations

emissionabsorption wavelength nm crimson6708 yellow5892 violet7665 redviolet7800 blue4555 the alkali metals are more similar to each other than the elements in any other group are to each other indeed the similarity is so great that it is quite difficult to separate potassium rubidium and caesium due to their similar ionic radii lithium and sodium are more distinct for instance when moving down the table all known alkali metals show increasing atomic radius decreasing electronegativity increasing reactivity and decreasing melting and boiling points as well as heats of fusion and vaporisation in general their densities increase when moving down the table with the exception that potassium is less dense than sodium one of the very few properties of the alkali metals that does not display a very smooth trend is their reduction potentials lithiums value is anomalous being more negative than the others this is because the li ion has a very high hydration energy in the gas phase though the lithium ion disrupts the structure of water significantly causing a higher change in entropy this high hydration energy is enough to make the reduction potentials indicate it as being the most electropositive alkali metal despite the difficulty of ionising it in the gas phase the stable alkali metals are all silvercoloured metals except for caesium which has a pale golden tint it is one of only three metals that are clearly coloured the other two being copper and gold additionally the heavy alkaline earth metals calcium strontium and barium as well as the divalent lanthanides europium and ytterbium are pale yellow though the colour is much less prominent than it is for caesium their lustre tarnishes rapidly in air due to oxidation they all crystallise in the bodycentered cubic crystal structure and have distinctive flame colours because their outer s electron is very easily excited indeed these flame test colours are the most common way of identifying them since all their salts with common ions are soluble potassium reacts violently with water at room temperature caesium reacts explosively with water even at low temperatures all the alkali metals are highly reactive and are never found in elemental forms in nature because of this they are usually stored in mineral oil or kerosene paraffin oil they react aggressively with the halogens to form the alkali metal halides which are white ionic crystalline compounds that are all soluble in water except lithium fluoride lif the alkali metals also react with water to form strongly alkaline hydroxides and thus should be handled with great care the heavier alkali metals react more vigorously than the lighter ones for example when dropped into water caesium produces a larger explosion than potassium if the same number of moles of each metal is used the alkali metals have the lowest first ionisation energies in their respective periods of the periodic table because of their low effective nuclear charge and the ability to attain a noble gas configuration by losing just one electron not only do the alkali metals react with water but also with proton donors like alcohols and phenols gaseous ammonia and alkynes the last demonstrating the phenomenal degree of their reactivity their great power as reducing agents makes them very useful in liberating other metals from their oxides or halides the second ionisation energy of all of the alkali metals is very high as it is in a full shell that is also closer to the nucleus thus they almost always lose a single electron forming cations the alkalides are an exception they are unstable compounds which contain alkali metals in a 1 oxidation state which is very unusual as before the discovery of the alkalides the alkali metals were not expected to be able to form anions and were thought to be able to appear in salts only as cations the alkalide anions have filled ssubshells which gives them enough stability to exist all the stable alkali metals except lithium are known to be able to form alkalides and the alkalides have much theoretical interest due to their unusual stoichiometry and low ionisation potentials alkalides are chemically similar to the electrides which are salts with trapped electrons acting as anions a particularly striking example of an alkalide is inverse sodium hydride hna both ions being complexed as opposed to the usual sodium hydride nah it is unstable in isolation due to its high energy resulting from the displacement of two electrons from hydrogen to sodium although several derivatives are predicted to be metastable or stable in aqueous solution the alkali metal ions form aqua ions of the formula mh2on where n is the solvation number their coordination numbers and shapes agree well with those expected from their ionic radii in aqueous solution the water molecules directly attached to the metal ion are said to belong to the first coordination sphere also known as the first or primary solvation shell the bond between a water molecule and the metal ion is a dative covalent bond with the oxygen atom donating both electrons to the bond each coordinated water molecule may be attached by hydrogen bonds to other water molecules the latter are said to reside in the second coordination sphere however for the alkali metal cations the second coordination sphere is not welldefined as the 1 charge on the cation is not high enough to polarise the water molecules in the primary solvation shell enough for them to form strong hydrogen bonds with those in the second coordination sphere producing a more stable entity the solvation number for li has been experimentally determined to be 4 forming the tetrahedral lih2o4 while solvation numbers of 3 to 6 have been found for lithium aqua ions solvation numbers less than 4 may be the result of the formation of contact ion pairs and the higher solvation numbers may be interpreted in terms of water molecules that approach lih2o4 through a face of the tetrahedron though molecular dynamic simulations may indicate the existence of an octahedral hexaaqua ion there are also probably six water molecules in the primary solvation sphere of the sodium ion forming the octahedral nah2o6 ion while it was previously thought that the heavier alkali metals also formed octahedral hexaaqua ions it has since been found that potassium and rubidium probably form the kh2o8 and rbh2o8 ions which have the square antiprismatic structure and that caesium forms the 12coordinate csh2o12 ion lithium the chemistry of lithium shows several differences from that of the rest of the group as the small li cation polarises anions and gives its compounds a more covalent character lithium and magnesium have a diagonal relationship due to their similar atomic radii so that they show some similarities for example lithium forms a stable nitride a property common among all the alkaline earth metals magnesiums group but unique among the alkali metals in addition among their respective groups only lithium and magnesium form organometallic compounds with significant covalent character eg lime and mgme2 lithium fluoride is the only alkali metal halide that is poorly soluble in water and lithium hydroxide is the only alkali metal hydroxide that is not deliquescent conversely lithium perchlorate and other lithium salts with large anions that cannot be polarised are much more stable than the analogous compounds of the other alkali metals probably because li has a high solvation energy this effect also means that most simple lithium salts are commonly encountered in hydrated form because the anhydrous forms are extremely hygroscopic this allows salts like lithium chloride and lithium bromide to be used in dehumidifiers and airconditioners francium francium is also predicted to show some differences due to its high atomic weight causing its electrons to travel at considerable fractions of the speed of light and thus making relativistic effects more prominent in contrast to the trend of decreasing electronegativities and ionisation energies of the alkali metals franciums electronegativity and ionisation energy are predicted to be higher than caesiums due to the relativistic stabilisation of the 7s electrons also its atomic radius is expected to be abnormally low thus contrary to expectation caesium is the most reactive of the alkali metals not francium all known physical properties of francium also deviate from the clear trends going from lithium to caesium such as the first ionisation energy electron affinity and anion polarisability though due to the paucity of known data about francium many sources give extrapolated values ignoring that relativistic effects make the trend from lithium to caesium become inapplicable at francium some of the few properties of francium that have been predicted taking relativity into account are the electron affinity 472 kjmol and the enthalpy of dissociation of the fr2 molecule 421 kjmol the csfr molecule is polarised as csfr showing that the 7s subshell of francium is much more strongly affected by relativistic effects than the 6s subshell of caesium additionally francium superoxide fro2 is expected to have significant covalent character unlike the other alkali metal superoxides because of bonding contributions from the 6p electrons of francium nuclear primordial isotopes of the alkali metals z alkali metal stable decays unstable italicsoddodd isotopes coloured pink 3 lithium 2 11 sodium 1 19 potassium 2 37 rubidium 1 55 caesium 1 87 francium no primordial isotopes is a radiogenic nuclide radioactive all the alkali metals have odd atomic numbers hence their isotopes must be either oddodd both proton and neutron number are odd or oddeven proton number is odd but neutron number is even oddodd nuclei have even mass numbers whereas oddeven nuclei have odd mass numbers oddodd primordial nuclides are rare because most oddodd nuclei are highly unstable with respect to beta decay because the decay products are eveneven and are therefore more strongly bound due to nuclear pairing effects due to the great rarity of oddodd nuclei almost all the primordial isotopes of the alkali metals are oddeven the exceptions being the light stable isotope lithium6 and the longlived radioisotope potassium40 for a given odd mass number there can be only a single betastable nuclide since there is not a difference in binding energy between evenodd and oddeven comparable to that between eveneven and oddodd leaving other nuclides of the same mass number isobars free to beta decay toward the lowestmass nuclide an effect of the instability of an odd number of either type of nucleons is that oddnumbered elements such as the alkali metals tend to have fewer stable isotopes than evennumbered elements of the 26 monoisotopic elements that have only a single stable isotope all but one have an odd atomic number and all but one also have an even number of neutrons beryllium is the single exception to both rules due to its low atomic number all of the alkali metals except lithium and caesium have at least one naturally occurring radioisotope sodium22 and sodium24 are trace radioisotopes produced cosmogenically potassium40 and rubidium87 have very long halflives and thus occur naturally and all isotopes of francium are radioactive caesium was also thought to be radioactive in the early 20th century although it has no naturally occurring radioisotopes francium had not been discovered yet at that time the natural longlived radioisotope of potassium potassium40 makes up about 0012 of natural potassium and thus natural potassium is weakly radioactive this natural radioactivity became a basis for a mistaken claim of the discovery for element 87 the next alkali metal after caesium in 1925 natural rubidium is similarly slightly radioactive with 2783 being the longlived radioisotope rubidium87 caesium137 with a halflife of 3017 years is one of the two principal mediumlived fission products along with strontium90 which are responsible for most of the radioactivity of spent nuclear fuel after several years of cooling up to several hundred years after use it constitutes most of the radioactivity still left from the chernobyl accident caesium137 undergoes highenergy beta decay and eventually becomes stable barium137 it is a strong emitter of gamma radiation caesium137 has a very low rate of neutron capture and cannot be feasibly disposed of in this way but must be allowed to decay caesium137 has been used as a tracer in hydrologic studies analogous to the use of tritium small amounts of caesium134 and caesium137 were released into the environment during nearly all nuclear weapon tests and some nuclear accidents most notably the goiânia accident and the chernobyl disaster as of 2005 caesium137 is the principal source of radiation in the zone of alienation around the chernobyl nuclear power plant its chemical properties as one of the alkali metals make it one of most problematic of the shorttomediumlifetime fission products because it easily moves and spreads in nature due to the high water solubility of its salts and is taken up by the body which mistakes it for its essential congeners sodium and potassium
60,the production of pure alkali metals is somewhat complicated due to their extreme reactivity with commonly used substances such as water from their silicate ores all the stable alkali metals may be obtained the same way sulfuric acid is first used to dissolve the desired alkali metal ion and aluminiumiii ions from the ore leaching whereupon basic precipitation removes aluminium ions from the mixture by precipitating it as the hydroxide the remaining insoluble alkali metal carbonate is then precipitated selectively the salt is then dissolved in hydrochloric acid to produce the chloride the result is then left to evaporate and the alkali metal can then be isolated lithium and sodium are typically isolated through electrolysis from their liquid chlorides with calcium chloride typically added to lower the melting point of the mixture the heavier alkali metals however is more typically isolated in a different way where a reducing agent typically sodium for potassium and magnesium or calcium for the heaviest alkali metals is used to reduce the alkali metal chloride the liquid or gaseous product the alkali metal then undergoes fractional distillation for purification lithium salts have to be extracted from the water of mineral springs brine pools and brine deposits the metal is produced electrolytically from a mixture of fused lithium chloride and potassium chloride sodium occurs mostly in seawater and dried seabed but is now produced through electrolysis of sodium chloride by lowering the melting point of the substance to below 700 c through the use of a downs cell extremely pure sodium can be produced through the thermal decomposition of sodium azide potassium occurs in many minerals such as sylvite potassium chloride previously potassium was generally made from the electrolysis of potassium chloride or potassium hydroxide found extensively in places such as canada russia belarus germany israel united states and jordan in a method similar to how sodium was produced in the late 1800s and early 1900s it can also be produced from seawater however these methods are problematic because the potassium metal tends to dissolve in its molten chloride and vaporises significantly at the operating temperatures potentially forming the explosive superoxide as a result pure potassium metal is now produced by reducing molten potassium chloride with sodium metal at 850 c na g kcl l nacl l k g although sodium is less reactive than potassium this process works because at such high temperatures potassium is more volatile than sodium and can easily be distilled off so that the equilibrium shifts towards the right to produce more potassium gas and proceeds almost to completion this sample of alta shiny gray 5centimeter piece of matter with a rough surface for several years in the 1950s and 1960s a byproduct of the potassium production called alkarb was a main source for rubidium alkarb contained 21 rubidium while the rest was potassium and a small fraction of caesium today the largest producers of caesium for example the tanco mine in manitoba canada produce rubidium as byproduct from pollucite today a common method for separating rubidium from potassium and caesium is the fractional crystallisation of a rubidium and caesium alum csrbalso4212h2o which yields pure rubidium alum after approximately 30 recrystallisations the limited applications and the lack of a mineral rich in rubidium limit the production of rubidium compounds to 2 to 4 tonnes per year caesium however is not produced from the above reaction instead the mining of pollucite ore is the main method of obtaining pure caesium extracted from the ore mainly by three methods acid digestion alkaline decomposition and direct reduction both metals are produced as byproducts of lithium production after 1958 when interest in lithiums thermonuclear properties increased sharply the production of rubidium and caesium also increased correspondingly pure rubidium and caesium metals are produced by reducing their chlorides with calcium metal at 750 c and low pressure as a result of its extreme rarity in nature most francium is synthesised in the nuclear reaction 197au 18o 210fr 5 n yielding francium209 francium210 and francium211 the greatest quantity of francium ever assembled to date is about 300000 neutral atoms which were synthesised using the nuclear reaction given above when the only natural isotope francium223 is specifically required it is produced as the alpha daughter of actinium227 itself produced synthetically from the neutron irradiation of natural radium226 one of the daughters of natural uranium238
60,the alkali metals form complete series of compounds with all usually encountered anions which well illustrate group trends these compounds can be described as involving the alkali metals losing electrons to acceptor species and forming monopositive ions this description is most accurate for alkali halides and becomes less and less accurate as cationic and anionic charge increase and as the anion becomes larger and more polarisable for instance ionic bonding gives way to metallic bonding along the series nacl na2o na2s na3p na3as na3sb na3bi na hydroxides pounds 14 kg of sodium with water all the alkali metals react vigorously or explosively with cold water producing an aqueous solution of a strongly basic alkali metal hydroxide and releasing hydrogen gas this reaction becomes more vigorous going down the group lithium reacts steadily with effervescence but sodium and potassium can ignite and rubidium and caesium sink in water and generate hydrogen gas so rapidly that shock waves form in the water that may shatter glass containers when an alkali metal is dropped into water it produces an explosion of which there are two separate stages the metal reacts with the water first breaking the hydrogen bonds in the water and producing hydrogen gas this takes place faster for the more reactive heavier alkali metals second the heat generated by the first part of the reaction often ignites the hydrogen gas causing it to burn explosively into the surrounding air this secondary hydrogen gas explosion produces the visible flame above the bowl of water lake or other body of water not the initial reaction of the metal with water which tends to happen mostly under water the alkali metal hydroxides are the most basic known hydroxides recent research has suggested that the explosive behavior of alkali metals in water is driven by a coulomb explosion rather than solely by rapid generation of hydrogen itself all alkali metals melt as a part of the reaction with water water molecules ionise the bare metallic surface of the liquid metal leaving a positively charged metal surface and negatively charged water ions the attraction between the charged metal and water ions will rapidly increase the surface area causing an exponential increase of ionisation when the repulsive forces within the liquid metal surface exceeds the forces of the surface tension it vigorously explodes the hydroxides themselves are the most basic hydroxides known reacting with acids to give salts and with alcohols to give oligomeric alkoxides they easily react with carbon dioxide to form carbonates or bicarbonates or with hydrogen sulfide to form sulfides or bisulfides and may be used to separate thiols from petroleum they react with amphoteric oxides for example the oxides of aluminium zinc tin and lead react with the alkali metal hydroxides to give aluminates zincates stannates and plumbates silicon dioxide is acidic and thus the alkali metal hydroxides can also attack silicate glass intermetallic compounds liquid nak alloy at room temperature the alkali metals form many intermetallic compounds with each other and the elements from groups 2 to 13 in the periodic table of varying stoichiometries such as the sodium amalgams with mercury including na5hg8 and na3hg some of these have ionic characteristics taking the alloys with gold the most electronegative of metals as an example naau and kau are metallic but rbau and csau are semiconductors nak is an alloy of sodium and potassium that is very useful because it is liquid at room temperature although precautions must be taken due to its extreme reactivity towards water and air the eutectic mixture melts at 126 c an alloy of 41 caesium 47 sodium and 12 potassium has the lowest known melting point of any metal or alloy 78 c compounds with the group 13 elements the intermetallic compounds of the alkali metals with the heavier group 13 elements aluminium gallium indium and thallium such as natl are poor conductors or semiconductors unlike the normal alloys with the preceding elements implying that the alkali metal involved has lost an electron to the zintl anions involved nevertheless while the elements in group 14 and beyond tend to form discrete anionic clusters group 13 elements tend to form polymeric ions with the alkali metal cations located between the giant ionic lattice for example natl consists of a polymeric anion tln with a covalent diamond cubic structure with na ions located between the anionic lattice the larger alkali metals cannot fit similarly into an anionic lattice and tend to force the heavier group 13 elements to form anionic clusters boron is a special case being the only nonmetal in group 13 the alkali metal borides tend to be boronrich involving appreciable boronboron bonding involving deltahedral structures and are thermally unstable due to the alkali metals having a very high vapour pressure at elevated temperatures this makes direct synthesis problematic because the alkali metals do not react with boron below 700 c and thus this must be accomplished in sealed containers with the alkali metal in excess furthermore exceptionally in this group reactivity with boron decreases down the group lithium reacts completely at 700 c but sodium at 900 c and potassium not until 1200 c and the reaction is instantaneous for lithium but takes hours for potassium rubidium and caesium borides have not even been characterised various phases are known such as lib10 nab6 nab15 and kb6 under high pressure the boronboron bonding in the lithium borides changes from following wades rules to forming zintl anions like the rest of group 13 compounds with the group 14 elements lithium and sodium react with carbon to form acetylides li2c2 and na2c2 which can also be obtained by reaction of the metal with acetylene potassium rubidium and caesium react with graphite their atoms are intercalated between the hexagonal graphite layers forming graphite intercalation compounds of formulae mc60 dark grey almost black mc48 dark grey almost black mc36 blue mc24 steel blue and mc8 bronze m k rb or cs these compounds are over 200 times more electrically conductive than pure graphite suggesting that the valence electron of the alkali metal is transferred to the graphite layers eg upon heating of kc8 the elimination of potassium atoms results in the conversion in sequence to kc24 kc36 kc48 and finally kc60 kc8 is a very strong reducing agent and is pyrophoric and explodes on contact with water while the larger alkali metals k rb and cs initially form mc8 the smaller ones initially form mc6 and indeed they require reaction of the metals with graphite at high temperatures around 500 c to form apart from this the alkali metals are such strong reducing agents that they can even reduce buckminsterfullerene to produce solid fullerides mnc60 sodium potassium rubidium and caesium can form fullerides where n 2 3 4 or 6 and rubidium and caesium additionally can achieve n 1 when the alkali metals react with the heavier elements in the carbon group silicon germanium tin and lead ionic substances with cagelike structures are formed such as the silicides m4si4 m k rb or cs which contains m and tetrahedral ions the chemistry of alkali metal germanides involving the germanide ion ge4 and other cluster zintl ions such as and ge926 is largely analogous to that of the corresponding silicides alkali metal stannides are mostly ionic sometimes with the stannide ion sn4 and sometimes with more complex zintl ions such as which appears in tetrapotassium nonastannide k4sn9 the monatomic plumbide ion pb4 is unknown and indeed its formation is predicted to be energetically unfavourable alkali metal plumbides have complex zintl ions such as these alkali metal germanides stannides and plumbides may be produced by reducing germanium tin and lead with sodium metal in liquid ammonia nitrides and pnictides unit cell ballandstick model of lithium nitride on the basis of size a tetrahedral structure would be expected but that would be geometrically impossible thus lithium nitride takes on this unique crystal structure lithium the lightest of the alkali metals is the only alkali metal which reacts with nitrogen at standard conditions and its nitride is the only stable alkali metal nitride nitrogen is an unreactive gas because breaking the strong triple bond in the dinitrogen molecule n2 requires a lot of energy the formation of an alkali metal nitride would consume the ionisation energy of the alkali metal forming m ions the energy required to break the triple bond in n2 and the formation of n3 ions and all the energy released from the formation of an alkali metal nitride is from the lattice energy of the alkali metal nitride the lattice energy is maximised with small highly charged ions the alkali metals do not form highly charged ions only forming ions with a charge of 1 so only lithium the smallest alkali metal can release enough lattice energy to make the reaction with nitrogen exothermic forming lithium nitride the reactions of the other alkali metals with nitrogen would not release enough lattice energy and would thus be endothermic so they do not form nitrides at standard conditions sodium nitride na3n and potassium nitride k3n while existing are extremely unstable being prone to decomposing back into their constituent elements and cannot be produced by reacting the elements with each other at standard conditions steric hindrance forbids the existence of rubidium or caesium nitride however sodium and potassium form colourless azide salts involving the linear anion due to the large size of the alkali metal cations they are thermally stable enough to be able to melt before decomposing all the alkali metals react readily with phosphorus and arsenic to form phosphides and arsenides with the formula m3pn where m represents an alkali metal and pn represents a pnictogen phosphorus arsenic antimony or bismuth this is due to the greater size of the p3 and as3 ions so that less lattice energy needs to be released for the salts to form these are not the only phosphides and arsenides of the alkali metals for example potassium has nine different known phosphides with formulae k3p k4p3 k5p4 kp k4p6 k3p7 k3p11 kp103 and kp15 while most metals form arsenides only the alkali and alkaline earth metals form mostly ionic arsenides the structure of na3as is complex with unusually short nana distances of 328330 pm which are shorter than in sodium metal and this indicates that even with these electropositive metals the bonding cannot be straightforwardly ionic other alkali metal arsenides not conforming to the formula m3as are known such as lias which has a metallic lustre and electrical conductivity indicating the presence of some metallic bonding the antimonides are unstable and reactive as the sb3 ion is a strong reducing agent reaction of them with acids form the toxic and unstable gas stibine sbh3 indeed they have some metallic properties and the alkali metal antimonides of stoichiometry msb involve antimony atoms bonded in a spiral zintl structure bismuthides are not even wholly ionic they are intermetallic compounds containing partially metallic and partially ionic bonds oxides and chalcogenides all the alkali metals react vigorously with oxygen at standard conditions they form various types of oxides such as simple oxides containing the o2 ion peroxides containing the ion where there is a single bond between the two oxygen atoms superoxides containing the ion and many others lithium burns in air to form lithium oxide but sodium reacts with oxygen to form a mixture of sodium oxide and sodium peroxide potassium forms a mixture of potassium peroxide and potassium superoxide while rubidium and caesium form the superoxide exclusively their reactivity increases going down the group while lithium sodium and potassium merely burn in air rubidium and caesium are pyrophoric spontaneously catch fire in air the smaller alkali metals tend to polarise the larger anions the peroxide and superoxide due to their small size this attracts the electrons in the more complex anions towards one of its constituent oxygen atoms forming an oxide ion and an oxygen atom this causes lithium to form the oxide exclusively on reaction with oxygen at room temperature this effect becomes drastically weaker for the larger sodium and potassium allowing them to form the less stable peroxides rubidium and caesium at the bottom of the group are so large that even the least stable superoxides can form because the superoxide releases the most energy when formed the superoxide is preferentially formed for the larger alkali metals where the more complex anions are not polarised the oxides and peroxides for these alkali metals do exist but do not form upon direct reaction of the metal with oxygen at standard conditions in addition the small size of the li and o2 ions contributes to their forming a stable ionic lattice structure under controlled conditions however all the alkali metals with the exception of francium are known to form their oxides peroxides and superoxides the alkali metal peroxides and superoxides are powerful oxidising agents sodium peroxide and potassium superoxide react with carbon dioxide to form the alkali metal carbonate and oxygen gas which allows them to be used in submarine air purifiers the presence of water vapour naturally present in breath makes the removal of carbon dioxide by potassium superoxide even more efficient all the stable alkali metals except lithium can form red ozonides mo3 through lowtemperature reaction of the powdered anhydrous hydroxide with ozone the ozonides may be then extracted using liquid ammonia they slowly decompose at standard conditions to the superoxides and oxygen and hydrolyse immediately to the hydroxides when in contact with water potassium rubidium and caesium also form sesquioxides m2o3 which may be better considered peroxide disuperoxides rubidium and caesium can form a great variety of suboxides with the metals in formal oxidation states below 1 rubidium can form rb6o and rb9o2 coppercoloured upon oxidation in air while caesium forms an immense variety of oxides such as the ozonide cso3 and several brightly coloured suboxides such as cs7o bronze cs4o redviolet cs11o3 violet cs3o dark green cso cs3o2 as well as cs7o2 the last of these may be heated under vacuum to generate cs2o the alkali metals can also react analogously with the heavier chalcogens sulfur selenium tellurium and polonium and all the alkali metal chalcogenides are known with the exception of franciums reaction with an excess of the chalcogen can similarly result in lower chalcogenides with chalcogen ions containing chains of the chalcogen atoms in question for example sodium can react with sulfur to form the sulfide na2s and various polysulfides with the formula na2sx x from 2 to 6 containing the ions due to the basicity of the se2 and te2 ions the alkali metal selenides and tellurides are alkaline in solution when reacted directly with selenium and tellurium alkali metal polyselenides and polytellurides are formed along with the selenides and tellurides with the and ions they may be obtained directly from the elements in liquid ammonia or when air is not present and are colourless watersoluble compounds that air oxidises quickly back to selenium or tellurium the alkali metal polonides are all ionic compounds containing the po2 ion they are very chemically stable and can be produced by direct reaction of the elements at around 300400 c halides hydrides and pseudohalides the alkali metals are among the most electropositive elements on the periodic table and thus tend to bond ionically to the most electronegative elements on the periodic table the halogens fluorine chlorine bromine iodine and astatine forming salts known as the alkali metal halides the reaction is very vigorous and can sometimes result in explosions all twenty stable alkali metal halides are known the unstable ones are not known with the exception of sodium astatide because of the great instability and rarity of astatine and francium the most wellknown of the twenty is certainly sodium chloride otherwise known as common salt all of the stable alkali metal halides have the formula mx where m is an alkali metal and x is a halogen they are all white ionic crystalline solids that have high melting points all the alkali metal halides are soluble in water except for lithium fluoride lif which is insoluble in water due to its very high lattice enthalpy the high lattice enthalpy of lithium fluoride is due to the small sizes of the li and f ions causing the electrostatic interactions between them to be strong a similar effect occurs for magnesium fluoride consistent with the diagonal relationship between lithium and magnesium the alkali metals also react similarly with hydrogen to form ionic alkali metal hydrides where the hydride anion acts as a pseudohalide these are often used as reducing agents producing hydrides complex metal hydrides or hydrogen gas other pseudohalides are also known notably the cyanides these are isostructural to the respective halides except for lithium cyanide indicating that the cyanide ions may rotate freely ternary alkali metal halide oxides such as na3clo k3bro yellow na4br2o na4i2o and k4br2o are also known the polyhalides are rather unstable although those of rubidium and caesium are greatly stabilised by the feeble polarising power of these extremely large cations coordination complexes alkali metal cations do not usually form coordination complexes with simple lewis bases due to their low charge of just 1 and their relatively large size thus the li ion forms most complexes and the heavier alkali metal ions form less and less though exceptions occur for weak complexes lithium in particular has a very rich coordination chemistry in which it exhibits coordination numbers from 1 to 12 although octahedral hexacoordination is its preferred mode in aqueous solution the alkali metal ions exist as octahedral hexahydrate complexes mh2o6 with the exception of the lithium ion which due to its small size forms tetrahedral tetrahydrate complexes lih2o4 the alkali metals form these complexes because their ions are attracted by electrostatic forces of attraction to the polar water molecules because of this anhydrous salts containing alkali metal cations are often used as desiccants alkali metals also readily form complexes with crown ethers eg 12crown4 for li 15crown5 for na 18crown6 for k and 21crown7 for rb and cryptands due to electrostatic attraction ammonia solutions the alkali metals dissolve slowly in liquid ammonia forming ammoniacal solutions of solvated m and e which react to form hydrogen gas and the alkali metal amide mnh2 where m represents an alkali metal this was first noted by humphry davy in 1809 and rediscovered by w weyl in 1864 the process may be speeded up by a catalyst similar solutions are formed by the heavy divalent alkaline earth metals calcium strontium barium as well as the divalent lanthanides europium and ytterbium the amide salt is quite insoluble and readily precipitates out of solution leaving intensely coloured ammonia solutions of the alkali metals in 1907 charles krause identified the colour as being due to the presence of solvated electrons which contribute to the high electrical conductivity of these solutions at low concentrations below 3 m the solution is dark blue and has ten times the conductivity of aqueous sodium chloride at higher concentrations above 3 m the solution is coppercoloured and has approximately the conductivity of liquid metals like mercury in addition to the alkali metal amide salt and solvated electrons such ammonia solutions also contain the alkali metal cation m the neutral alkali metal atom m diatomic alkali metal molecules m2 and alkali metal anions m these are unstable and eventually become the more thermodynamically stable alkali metal amide and hydrogen gas solvated electrons are powerful reducing agents and are often used in chemical synthesis organometallic organolithium nbutyllithium hexamer c4h9li6 the aggregates are held together by delocalised covalent bonds between lithium and the terminal carbon of the butyl chain there is no direct lithiumlithium bonding in any organolithium compound solid phenyllithium forms monoclinic crystals can be described as consisting of dimeric li2c6h52 subunits the lithium atoms and the ipso carbons of the phenyl rings form a planar fourmembered ring the plane of the phenyl groups are perpendicular to the plane of this li2c2 ring additional strong intermolecular bonding occurs between these phenyllithium dimers and the π electrons of the phenyl groups in the adjacent dimers resulting in an infinite polymeric ladder structure being the smallest alkali metal lithium forms the widest variety of and most stable organometallic compounds which are bonded covalently organolithium compounds are electrically nonconducting volatile solids or liquids that melt at low temperatures and tend to form oligomers with the structure rlix where r is the organic group as the electropositive nature of lithium puts most of the charge density of the bond on the carbon atom effectively creating a carbanion organolithium compounds are extremely powerful bases and nucleophiles for use as bases butyllithiums are often used and are commercially available an example of an organolithium compound is methyllithium ch3lix which exists in tetrameric x 4 tetrahedral and hexameric x 6 octahedral forms organolithium compounds especially nbutyllithium are useful reagents in organic synthesis as might be expected given lithiums diagonal relationship with magnesium which plays an important role in the grignard reaction for example alkyllithiums and aryllithiums may be used to synthesise aldehydes and ketones by reaction with metal carbonyls the reaction with nickel tetracarbonyl for example proceeds through an unstable acyl nickel carbonyl complex which then undergoes electrophilic substitution to give the desired aldehyde using h as the electrophile or ketone using an alkyl halide product lir nico4 lirconico3 lirconico3 li rcho solventnico3 lirconico3 li rcor solventnico3 alkyllithiums and aryllithiums may also react with nndisubstituted amides to give aldehydes and ketones and symmetrical ketones by reacting with carbon monoxide they thermally decompose to eliminate a βhydrogen producing alkenes and lithium hydride another route is the reaction of ethers with alkyl and aryllithiums that act as strong bases in nonpolar solvents aryllithiums react as the carbanions they effectively are turning carbon dioxide to aromatic carboxylic acids arco2h and aryl ketones to tertiary carbinols ar2caroh finally they may be used to synthesise other organometallic compounds through metalhalogen exchange heavier alkali metals unlike the organolithium compounds the organometallic compounds of the heavier alkali metals are predominantly ionic the application of organosodium compounds in chemistry is limited in part due to competition from organolithium compounds which are commercially available and exhibit more convenient reactivity the principal organosodium compound of commercial importance is sodium cyclopentadienide sodium tetraphenylborate can also be classified as an organosodium compound since in the solid state sodium is bound to the aryl groups organometallic compounds of the higher alkali metals are even more reactive than organosodium compounds and of limited utility a notable reagent is schlossers base a mixture of nbutyllithium and potassium tertbutoxide this reagent reacts with propene to form the compound allylpotassium kch2chch2 cis2butene and trans2butene equilibrate when in contact with alkali metals whereas isomerisation is fast with lithium and sodium it is slow with the heavier alkali metals the heavier alkali metals also favour the sterically congested conformation several crystal structures of organopotassium compounds have been reported establishing that they like the sodium compounds are polymeric organosodium organopotassium organorubidium and organocaesium compounds are all mostly ionic and are insoluble or nearly so in nonpolar solvents alkyl and aryl derivatives of sodium and potassium tend to react with air they cause the cleavage of ethers generating alkoxides unlike alkyllithium compounds alkylsodiums and alkylpotassiums cannot be made by reacting the metals with alkyl halides because wurtz coupling occurs rm rx rr mx as such they have to be made by reacting alkylmercury compounds with sodium or potassium metal in inert hydrocarbon solvents while methylsodium forms tetramers like methyllithium methylpotassium is more ionic and has the nickel arsenide structure with discrete methyl anions and potassium cations the alkali metals and their hydrides react with acidic hydrocarbons for example cyclopentadienes and terminal alkynes to give salts liquid ammonia ether or hydrocarbon solvents are used the most common of which being tetrahydrofuran the most important of these compounds is sodium cyclopentadienide nac5h5 an important precursor to many transition metal cyclopentadienyl derivatives similarly the alkali metals react with cyclooctatetraene in tetrahydrofuran to give alkali metal cyclooctatetraenides for example dipotassium cyclooctatetraenide k2c8h8 is an important precursor to many metal cyclooctatetraenyl derivatives such as uranocene the large and very weakly polarising alkali metal cations can stabilise large aromatic polarisable radical anions such as the darkgreen sodium naphthalenide nac10h8 a strong reducing agent
60,petalite the lithium mineral from which lithium was first isolated sodium compounds have been known since ancient times salt sodium chloride has been an important commodity in human activities as testified by the english word salary referring to salarium money paid to roman soldiers for the purchase of salt while potash has been used since ancient times it was not understood for most of its history to be a fundamentally different substance from sodium mineral salts georg ernst stahl obtained experimental evidence which led him to suggest the fundamental difference of sodium and potassium salts in 1702 and henri louis duhamel du monceau was able to prove this difference in 1736 the exact chemical composition of potassium and sodium compounds and the status as chemical element of potassium and sodium was not known then and thus antoine lavoisier did include the alkali in his list of chemical elements in 1789 pure potassium was first isolated in 1807 in england by sir humphry davy who derived it from caustic potash koh potassium hydroxide by the use of electrolysis of the molten salt with the newly invented voltaic pile previous attempts at electrolysis of the aqueous salt were unsuccessful due to potassiums extreme reactivity potassium was the first metal that was isolated by electrolysis later that same year davy reported extraction of sodium from the similar substance caustic soda naoh lye by a similar technique demonstrating the elements and thus the salts to be different later that year the first pieces of pure molten sodium metal were similarly prepared by humphry davy through the electrolysis of molten caustic soda now called sodium hydroxide johann wolfgang döbereiner was among the first to notice similarities between what are now known as the alkali metals petalite lialsi4o10 was discovered in 1800 by the brazilian chemist josé bonifácio de andrada in a mine on the island of utö sweden however it was not until 1817 that johan august arfwedson then working in the laboratory of the chemist jöns jacob berzelius detected the presence of a new element while analysing petalite ore this new element was noted by him to form compounds similar to those of sodium and potassium though its carbonate and hydroxide were less soluble in water and more alkaline than the other alkali metals berzelius gave the unknown material the name lithionlithina from the greek word λιθoς transliterated as lithos meaning stone to reflect its discovery in a solid mineral as opposed to potassium which had been discovered in plant ashes and sodium which was known partly for its high abundance in animal blood he named the metal inside the material lithium lithium sodium and potassium were part of the discovery of periodicity as they are among a series of triads of elements in the same group that were noted by johann wolfgang döbereiner in 1850 as having similar properties lepidolite the rubidium mineral from which rubidium was first isolated rubidium and caesium were the first elements to be discovered using the spectroscope invented in 1859 by robert bunsen and gustav kirchhoff the next year they discovered caesium in the mineral water from bad dürkheim germany their discovery of rubidium came the following year in heidelberg germany finding it in the mineral lepidolite the names of rubidium and caesium come from the most prominent lines in their emission spectra a bright red line for rubidium from the latin word rubidus meaning dark red or bright red and a skyblue line for caesium derived from the latin word caesius meaning skyblue around 1865 john newlands produced a series of papers where he listed the elements in order of increasing atomic weight and similar physical and chemical properties that recurred at intervals of eight he likened such periodicity to the octaves of music where notes an octave apart have similar musical functions his version put all the alkali metals then known lithium to caesium as well as copper silver and thallium which show the 1 oxidation state characteristic of the alkali metals together into a group his table placed hydrogen with the halogens mendeleevs periodic system proposed in 1871 showing hydrogen and the alkali metals as part of his group i along with copper silver and gold after 1869 dmitri mendeleev proposed his periodic table placing lithium at the top of a group with sodium potassium rubidium caesium and thallium two years later mendeleev revised his table placing hydrogen in group 1 above lithium and also moving thallium to the boron group in this 1871 version copper silver and gold were placed twice once as part of group ib and once as part of a group viii encompassing todays groups 8 to 11 after the introduction of the 18column table the group ib elements were moved to their current position in the dblock while alkali metals were left in group ia later the groups name was changed to group 1 in 1988 the trivial name alkali metals comes from the fact that the hydroxides of the group 1 elements are all strong alkalis when dissolved in water there were at least four erroneous and incomplete discoveries before marguerite perey of the curie institute in paris france discovered francium in 1939 by purifying a sample of actinium227 which had been reported to have a decay energy of 220 kev however perey noticed decay particles with an energy level below 80 kev perey thought this decay activity might have been caused by a previously unidentified decay product one that was separated during purification but emerged again out of the pure actinium227 various tests eliminated the possibility of the unknown element being thorium radium lead bismuth or thallium the new product exhibited chemical properties of an alkali metal such as coprecipitating with caesium salts which led perey to believe that it was element 87 caused by the alpha decay of actinium227 perey then attempted to determine the proportion of beta decay to alpha decay in actinium227 her first test put the alpha branching at 06 a figure that she later revised to 1 the next element below francium ekafrancium in the periodic table would be ununennium uue element 119 the synthesis of ununennium was first attempted in 1985 by bombarding a target of einsteinium254 with calcium48 ions at the superhilac accelerator at berkeley california no atoms were identified leading to a limiting yield of 300 nb no atoms it is highly unlikely that this reaction will be able to create any atoms of ununennium in the near future given the extremely difficult task of making sufficient amounts of einsteinium254 which is favoured for production of ultraheavy elements because of its large mass relatively long halflife of 270 days and availability in significant amounts of several micrograms to make a large enough target to increase the sensitivity of the experiment to the required level einsteinium has not been found in nature and has only been produced in laboratories and in quantities smaller than those needed for effective synthesis of ultraheavy elements however given that ununennium is only the first period 8 element on the extended periodic table it may well be discovered in the near future through other reactions and indeed attempts to synthesise it in 2019 and 2020 are currently planned at laboratories at japan and russia currently none of the period 8 elements have been discovered yet and it is also possible due to drip instabilities that only the lower period 8 elements up to around element 128 are physically possible no attempts at synthesis have been made for any heavier alkali metals such as unhexpentium due to their extremely high atomic number they would require new more powerful technology to make

60,focs 1 a caesium atomic clock in switzerland lithium sodium and potassium have many applications while rubidium and caesium are very useful in academic contexts but do not have many applications yet lithium is often used in batteries and lithium oxide can help process silica lithium stearate is a thickener and can be used to make lubricating greases it is produced from lithium hydroxide which is also used to absorb carbon dioxide in space capsules and submarines lithium chloride is used as a brazing alloy for aluminium parts metallic lithium is used in alloys with magnesium and aluminium to give very tough and light alloys sodium compounds have many applications the most wellknown being sodium chloride as table salt sodium salts of fatty acids are used as soap pure sodium metal also has many applications including use in sodiumvapour lamps which produce very efficient light compared to other types of lighting and can help smooth the surface of other metals being a strong reducing agent it is often used to reduce many other metals such as titanium and zirconium from their chlorides furthermore it is very useful as a heatexchange liquid in fast breeder nuclear reactors due to its low melting point viscosity and crosssection towards neutron absorption potassium compounds are often used as fertilisers as potassium is an important element for plant nutrition potassium hydroxide is a very strong base and is used to control the ph of various substances potassium nitrate and potassium permanganate are often used as powerful oxidising agents potassium superoxide is used in breathing masks as it reacts with carbon dioxide to give potassium carbonate and oxygen gas pure potassium metal is not often used but its alloys with sodium may substitute for pure sodium in fast breeder nuclear reactors rubidium and caesium are often used in atomic clocks caesium atomic clocks are extraordinarily accurate if a clock had been made at the time of the dinosaurs it would be off by less than four seconds after 80 million years for that reason caesium atoms are used as the definition of the second rubidium ions are often used in purple fireworks and caesium is often used in drilling fluids in the petroleum industry francium has no commercial applications but because of franciums relatively simple atomic structure among other things it has been used in spectroscopy experiments leading to more information regarding energy levels and the coupling constants between subatomic particles studies on the light emitted by lasertrapped francium210 ions have provided accurate data on transitions between atomic energy levels similar to those predicted by quantum theory
60,the alkali metals are a group column in the periodic table consisting of the chemical elements lithium li sodium na potassium k rubidium rb caesium cs and francium fr this group lies in the sblock of the periodic table of elements as all alkali metals have their outermost electron in an sorbital this shared electron configuration results in them having very similar characteristic properties indeed the alkali metals provide the best example of group trends in properties in the periodic table with elements exhibiting wellcharacterised homologous behaviour the alkali metals are all shiny soft highly reactive metals at standard temperature and pressure and readily lose their outermost electron to form cations with charge 1 they can all be cut easily with a knife due to their softness exposing a shiny surface that tarnishes rapidly in air due to oxidation by atmospheric moisture and oxygen and in the case of lithium nitrogen because of their high reactivity they must be stored under oil to prevent reaction with air and are found naturally only in salts and never as the free elements caesium the fifth alkali metal is the most reactive of all the metals in the modern iupac nomenclature the alkali metals comprise the group 1 elements excluding hydrogen h which is nominally a group 1 element but not normally considered to be an alkali metal as it rarely exhibits behaviour comparable to that of the alkali metals all the alkali metals react with water with the heavier alkali metals reacting more vigorously than the lighter ones all of the discovered alkali metals occur in nature as their compounds in order of abundance sodium is the most abundant followed by potassium lithium rubidium caesium and finally francium which is very rare due to its extremely high radioactivity francium occurs only in the minutest traces in nature as an intermediate step in some obscure side branches of the natural decay chains experiments have been conducted to attempt the synthesis of ununennium uue which is likely to be the next member of the group but they have all met with failure however ununennium may not be an alkali metal due to relativistic effects which are predicted to have a large influence on the chemical properties of superheavy elements even if it does turn out to be an alkali metal it is predicted to have some differences in physical and chemical properties from its lighter homologues most alkali metals have many different applications one of the bestknown applications of the pure elements is the use of rubidium and caesium in atomic clocks of which caesium atomic clocks are the most accurate and precise representation of time a common application of the compounds of sodium is the sodiumvapour lamp which emits very efficient light table salt or sodium chloride has been used since antiquity sodium and potassium are also essential elements having major biological roles as electrolytes and although the other alkali metals are not essential they also have various effects on the body both beneficial and harmful __toc__
60,many other substances are similar to the alkali metals in their tendency to form monopositive cations analogously to the pseudohalogens they have sometimes been called pseudoalkali metals these substances include some elements and many more polyatomic ions the polyatomic ions are especially similar to the alkali metals in their large size and weak polarising power hydrogen the element hydrogen with one electron per neutral atom is usually placed at the top of group 1 of the periodic table for convenience but hydrogen is not normally considered to be an alkali metal when it is considered to be an alkali metal it is because of its atomic properties and not its chemical properties under typical conditions pure hydrogen exists as a diatomic gas consisting of two atoms per molecule h2 however the alkali metals only form diatomic molecules such as dilithium li2 at high temperatures when they are in the gaseous state hydrogen like the alkali metals has one valence electron and reacts easily with the halogens but the similarities end there because of the small size of a bare proton h compared to the alkali metal cations its placement above lithium is primarily due to its electron configuration it is sometimes placed above carbon due to their similar electronegativities or fluorine due to their similar chemical properties the first ionisation energy of hydrogen 13120 kjmol is much higher than that of the alkali metals as only one additional electron is required to fill in the outermost shell of the hydrogen atom hydrogen often behaves like a halogen forming the negative hydride ion and is very occasionally considered to be a halogen on that basis the alkali metals can also form negative ions known as alkalides but these are little more than laboratory curiosities being unstable an argument against this placement is that formation of hydride from hydrogen is endothermic unlike the exothermic formation of halides from halogens the radius of the h anion also does not fit the trend of increasing size going down the halogens indeed h is very diffuse because its single proton cannot easily control both electrons it was expected for some time that liquid hydrogen would show metallic properties while this has been shown to not be the case under extremely high pressures such as those found at the cores of jupiter and saturn hydrogen does become metallic and behaves like an alkali metal in this phase it is known as metallic hydrogen the electrical resistivity of liquid metallic hydrogen at 3000 k is approximately equal to that of liquid rubidium and caesium at 2000 k at the respective pressures when they undergo a nonmetaltometal transition the 1s1 electron configuration of hydrogen while superficially similar to that of the alkali metals ns1 is unique because there is no 1p subshell hence it can lose an electron to form the hydron h or gain one to form the hydride ion h in the former case it resembles superficially the alkali metals in the latter case the halogens but the differences due to the lack of a 1p subshell are important enough that neither group fits the properties of hydrogen well group 14 is also a good fit in terms of thermodynamic properties such as ionisation energy and electron affinity but makes chemical nonsense because hydrogen cannot be tetravalent thus none of the three placements are entirely satisfactory although group 1 is the most common placement if one is chosen because the hydron is by far the most important of all monatomic hydrogen species being the foundation of acidbase chemistry as an example of hydrogens unorthodox properties stemming from its unusual electron configuration and small size the hydrogen ion is very small radius around 150 fm compared to the 50220 pm size of most other atoms and ions and so is nonexistent in condensed systems other than in association with other atoms or molecules indeed transferring of protons between chemicals is the basis of acidbase chemistry also unique is hydrogens ability to form hydrogen bonds which are an effect of chargetransfer electrostatic and electron correlative contributing phenomena while analogous lithium bonds are also known they are mostly electrostatic nevertheless hydrogen can take on the same structural role as the alkali metals in some molecular crystals and has a close relationship with the lightest alkali metals especially lithium ammonium and derivatives similarly to the alkali metals ammonia reacts with hydrochloric acid to form the salt ammonium chloride the ammonium ion has very similar properties to the heavier alkali metals acting as an alkali metal intermediate between potassium and rubidium and is often considered a close relative for example most alkali metal salts are soluble in water a property which ammonium salts share ammonium is expected to behave stably as a metal ions in a sea of delocalised electrons at very high pressures though less than the typical pressure where transitions from insulating to metallic behaviour occur around 100 gpa and could possibly occur inside the ice giants uranus and neptune which may have significant impacts on their interior magnetic fields it has been estimated that the transition from a mixture of ammonia and dihydrogen molecules to metallic ammonium may occur at pressures just below 25 gpa under standard conditions ammonium can form a metallic amalgam with mercury other pseudoalkali metals include the alkylammonium cations in which some of the hydrogen atoms in the ammonium cation are replaced by alkyl or aryl groups in particular the quaternary ammonium cations are very useful since they are permanently charged and they are often used as an alternative to the expensive cs to stabilise very large and very easily polarisable anions such as tetraalkylammonium hydroxides like alkali metal hydroxides are very strong bases that react with atmospheric carbon dioxide to form carbonates furthermore the nitrogen atom may be replaced by a phosphorus arsenic or antimony atom the heavier nonmetallic pnictogens creating a phosphonium or arsonium cation that can itself be substituted similarly while stibonium itself is not known some of its organic derivatives are characterised cobaltocene and derivatives cobaltocene coc5h52 is a metallocene the cobalt analogue of ferrocene it is a dark purple solid cobaltocene has 19 valence electrons one more than usually found in organotransition metal complexes such as its very stable relative ferrocene in accordance with the 18electron rule this additional electron occupies an orbital that is antibonding with respect to the coc bonds consequently many chemical reactions of coc5h52 are characterized by its tendency to lose this extra electron yielding a very stable 18electron cation known as cobaltocenium many cobaltocenium salts coprecipitate with caesium salts and cobaltocenium hydroxide is a strong base that absorbs atmospheric carbon dioxide to form cobaltocenium carbonate like the alkali metals cobaltocene is a strong reducing agent and decamethylcobaltocene is stronger still due to the combined inductive effect of the ten methyl groups cobalt may be substituted by its heavier congener rhodium to give rhodocene an even stronger reducing agent iridocene involving iridium would presumably be still more potent but is not very wellstudied due to its instability thallium very pure thallium pieces in a glass ampoule stored under argon gas thallium is the heaviest stable element in group 13 of the periodic table at the bottom of the periodic table the inert pair effect is quite strong because of the relativistic stabilisation of the 6s orbital and the decreasing bond energy as the atoms increase in size so that the amount of energy released in forming two more bonds is not worth the high ionisation energies of the 6s electrons it displays the 1 oxidation state that all the known alkali metals display and thallium compounds with thallium in its 1 oxidation state closely resemble the corresponding potassium or silver compounds stoichiometrically due to the similar ionic radii of the tl 164 pm k 152 pm and ag 129 pm ions it was sometimes considered an alkali metal in continental europe but not in england in the years immediately following its discovery and was placed just after caesium as the sixth alkali metal in dmitri mendeleevs 1869 periodic table and julius lothar meyers 1868 periodic table mendeleevs 1871 periodic table and meyers 1870 periodic table put thallium in its current position in the boron group and left the space below caesium blank however thallium also displays the oxidation state 3 which no known alkali metal displays although ununennium the undiscovered seventh alkali metal is predicted to possibly display the 3 oxidation state the sixth alkali metal is now considered to be francium while tl is stabilised by the inert pair effect this inert pair of 6s electrons is still able to participate chemically so that these electrons are stereochemically active in aqueous solution additionally the thallium halides except tlf are quite insoluble in water and tli has an unusual structure because of the presence of the stereochemically active inert pair in thallium copper silver and gold the group 11 metals or coinage metals copper silver and gold are typically categorised as transition metals given they can form ions with incomplete dshells physically they have the relatively low melting points and high electronegativity values associated with posttransition metals the filled d subshell and free s electron of cu ag and au contribute to their high electrical and thermal conductivity transition metals to the left of group 11 experience interactions between s electrons and the partially filled d subshell that lower electron mobility chemically the group 11 metals behave like maingroup metals in their 1 valence states and are hence somewhat related to the alkali metals this is one reason for their previously being labelled as group ib paralleling the alkali metals group ia they are occasionally classified as posttransition metals their spectra are analogous to those of the alkali metals their monopositive ions are paramagnetic and contribute no colour to their salts like those of the alkali metals in mendeleevs 1871 periodic table copper silver and gold are listed twice once under group viii with the iron triad and platinum group metals and once under group ib group ib was nonetheless parenthesised to note that it was tentative mendeleevs main criterion for group assignment was the maximum oxidation state of an element on that basis the group 11 elements could not be classified in group ib due to the existence of copperii and goldiii compounds being known at that time however eliminating group ib would make group i the only main group group viii was labelled a transition group to lack an ab bifurcation soon afterward a majority of chemists chose to classify these elements in group ib and remove them from group viii for the resulting symmetry this was the predominant classification until the rise of the modern mediumlong 18column periodic table which separated the alkali metals and group 11 metals the coinage metals were traditionally regarded as a subdivision of the alkali metal group due to them sharing the characteristic s1 electron configuration of the alkali metals group 1 p6s1 group 11 d10s1 however the similarities are largely confined to the stoichiometries of the 1 compounds of both groups and not their chemical properties this stems from the filled d subshell providing a much weaker shielding effect on the outermost s electron than the filled p subshell so that the coinage metals have much higher first ionisation energies and smaller ionic radii than do the corresponding alkali metals furthermore they have higher melting points hardnesses and densities and lower reactivities and solubilities in liquid ammonia as well as having more covalent character in their compounds finally the alkali metals are at the top of the electrochemical series whereas the coinage metals are almost at the very bottom the coinage metals filled d shell is much more easily disrupted than the alkali metals filled p shell so that the second and third ionisation energies are lower enabling higher oxidation states than 1 and a richer coordination chemistry thus giving the group 11 metals clear transition metal character particularly noteworthy is gold forming ionic compounds with rubidium and caesium in which it forms the auride ion au which also occurs in solvated form in liquid ammonia solution here gold behaves as a pseudohalogen because its 5d106s1 configuration has one electron less than the quasiclosed shell 5d106s2 configuration of mercury

60,empirical nacs mgra and predicted fruhp ubnuhh atomic radius of the alkali and alkaline earth metals from the third to the ninth period measured in angstroms although francium is the heaviest alkali metal that has been discovered there has been some theoretical work predicting the physical and chemical characteristics of the hypothetical heavier alkali metals being the first period 8 element the undiscovered element ununennium element 119 is predicted to be the next alkali metal after francium and behave much like their lighter congeners however it is also predicted to differ from the lighter alkali metals in some properties its chemistry is predicted to be closer to that of potassium or rubidium instead of caesium or francium this is unusual as periodic trends ignoring relativistic effects would predict ununennium to be even more reactive than caesium and francium this lowered reactivity is due to the relativistic stabilisation of ununenniums valence electron increasing ununenniums first ionisation energy and decreasing the metallic and ionic radii this effect is already seen for francium this assumes that ununennium will behave chemically as an alkali metal which although likely may not be true due to relativistic effects the relativistic stabilisation of the 8s orbital also increases ununenniums electron affinity far beyond that of caesium and francium indeed ununennium is expected to have an electron affinity higher than all the alkali metals lighter than it relativistic effects also cause a very large drop in the polarisability of ununennium on the other hand ununennium is predicted to continue the trend of melting points decreasing going down the group being expected to have a melting point between 0 c and 30 c eighth period measured in electron volts the stabilisation of ununenniums valence electron and thus the contraction of the 8s orbital cause its atomic radius to be lowered to 240 pm very close to that of rubidium 247 pm so that the chemistry of ununennium in the 1 oxidation state should be more similar to the chemistry of rubidium than to that of francium on the other hand the ionic radius of the uue ion is predicted to be larger than that of rb because the 7p orbitals are destabilised and are thus larger than the porbitals of the lower shells ununennium may also show the 3 oxidation state which is not seen in any other alkali metal in addition to the 1 oxidation state that is characteristic of the other alkali metals and is also the main oxidation state of all the known alkali metals this is because of the destabilisation and expansion of the 7p32 spinor causing its outermost electrons to have a lower ionisation energy than what would otherwise be expected indeed many ununennium compounds are expected to have a large covalent character due to the involvement of the 7p32 electrons in the bonding empirical nafr mgra and predicted uueuhp ubnuhh ionisation energy of the alkali and alkaline earth metals from the third to the ninth period measured in electron volts not as much work has been done predicting the properties of the alkali metals beyond ununennium although a simple extrapolation of the periodic table would put element 169 unhexennium under ununennium diracfock calculations predict that the next alkali metal after ununennium may actually be element 165 unhexpentium which is predicted to have the electron configuration og 5 g18 6f14 7d10 8s2 8p122 9s1 furthermore this element would be intermediate in properties between an alkali metal and a group 11 element and while its physical and atomic properties would be closer to the former its chemistry may be closer to that of the latter further calculations show that unhexpentium would follow the trend of increasing ionisation energy beyond caesium having an ionisation energy comparable to that of sodium and that it should also continue the trend of decreasing atomic radii beyond caesium having an atomic radius comparable to that of potassium however the 7d electrons of unhexpentium may also be able to participate in chemical reactions along with the 9s electron possibly allowing oxidation states beyond 1 whence the likely transition metal behaviour of unhexpentium due to the alkali and alkaline earth metals both being sblock elements these predictions for the trends and properties of ununennium and unhexpentium also mostly hold quite similarly for the corresponding alkaline earth metals unbinilium ubn and unhexhexium uhh the probable properties of further alkali metals beyond unhexpentium have not been explored yet as of 2015 in fact it is suspected that they may not be able to exist in periods 8 and above of the periodic table relativistic and shellstructure effects become so strong that extrapolations from lighter congeners become completely inaccurate in addition the relativistic and shellstructure effects which stabilise the sorbitals and destabilise and expand the d f and gorbitals of higher shells have opposite effects causing even larger difference between relativistic and nonrelativistic calculations of the properties of elements with such high atomic numbers interest in the chemical properties of ununennium and unhexpentium stems from the fact that both elements are located close to the expected locations of islands of stabilities centered at elements 122 306ubb and 164 482uhq
60,the alkali metals are more similar to each other than the elements in any other group are to each other for instance when moving down the table all known alkali metals show increasing atomic radius decreasing electronegativity increasing reactivity and decreasing melting and boiling points as well as heats of fusion and vaporisation in general their densities increase when moving down the table with the exception that potassium is less dense than sodium atomic and ionic radii effective nuclear charge on an atomic electron the atomic radii of the alkali metals increase going down the group because of the shielding effect when an atom has more than one electron shell each electron feels electric repulsion from the other electrons as well as electric attraction from the nucleus in the alkali metals the outermost electron only feels a net charge of 1 as some of the nuclear charge which is equal to the atomic number is cancelled by the inner electrons the number of inner electrons of an alkali metal is always one less than the nuclear charge therefore the only factor which affects the atomic radius of the alkali metals is the number of electron shells since this number increases down the group the atomic radius must also increase down the group the ionic radii of the alkali metals are much smaller than their atomic radii this is because the outermost electron of the alkali metals is in a different electron shell than the inner electrons and thus when it is removed the resulting atom has one fewer electron shell and is smaller additionally the effective nuclear charge has increased and thus the electrons are attracted more strongly towards the nucleus and the ionic radius decreases first ionisation energy periodic trend for ionisation energy each period begins at a minimum for the alkali metals and ends at a maximum for the noble gases the first ionisation energy of an element or molecule is the energy required to move the most loosely held electron from one mole of gaseous atoms of the element or molecules to form one mole of gaseous ions with electric charge 1 the factors affecting the first ionisation energy are the nuclear charge the amount of shielding by the inner electrons and the distance from the most loosely held electron from the nucleus which is always an outer electron in main group elements the first two factors change the effective nuclear charge the most loosely held electron feels since the outermost electron of alkali metals always feels the same effective nuclear charge 1 the only factor which affects the first ionisation energy is the distance from the outermost electron to the nucleus since this distance increases down the group the outermost electron feels less attraction from the nucleus and thus the first ionisation energy decreases this trend is broken in francium due to the relativistic stabilisation and contraction of the 7s orbital bringing franciums valence electron closer to the nucleus than would be expected from nonrelativistic calculations this makes franciums outermost electron feel more attraction from the nucleus increasing its first ionisation energy slightly beyond that of caesium the second ionisation energy of the alkali metals is much higher than the first as the secondmost loosely held electron is part of a fully filled electron shell and is thus difficult to remove reactivity the reactivities of the alkali metals increase going down the group this is the result of a combination of two factors the first ionisation energies and atomisation energies of the alkali metals because the first ionisation energy of the alkali metals decreases down the group it is easier for the outermost electron to be removed from the atom and participate in chemical reactions thus increasing reactivity down the group the atomisation energy measures the strength of the metallic bond of an element which falls down the group as the atoms increase in radius and thus the metallic bond must increase in length making the delocalised electrons further away from the attraction of the nuclei of the heavier alkali metals adding the atomisation and first ionisation energies gives a quantity closely related to but not equal to the activation energy of the reaction of an alkali metal with another substance this quantity decreases going down the group and so does the activation energy thus chemical reactions can occur faster and the reactivity increases down the group electronegativity main groups of the periodic table from the second to the sixth period electronegativity is a chemical property that describes the tendency of an atom or a functional group to attract electrons or electron density towards itself if the bond between sodium and chlorine in sodium chloride were covalent the pair of shared electrons would be attracted to the chlorine because the effective nuclear charge on the outer electrons is 7 in chlorine but is only 1 in sodium the electron pair is attracted so close to the chlorine atom that they are practically transferred to the chlorine atom an ionic bond however if the sodium atom was replaced by a lithium atom the electrons will not be attracted as close to the chlorine atom as before because the lithium atom is smaller making the electron pair more strongly attracted to the closer effective nuclear charge from lithium hence the larger alkali metal atoms further down the group will be less electronegative as the bonding pair is less strongly attracted towards them as mentioned previously francium is expected to be an exception because of the higher electronegativity of lithium some of its compounds have a more covalent character for example lithium iodide lii will dissolve in organic solvents a property of most covalent compounds lithium fluoride lif is the only alkali halide that is not soluble in water and lithium hydroxide lioh is the only alkali metal hydroxide that is not deliquescent melting and boiling points the melting point of a substance is the point where it changes state from solid to liquid while the boiling point of a substance in liquid state is the point where the vapour pressure of the liquid equals the environmental pressure surrounding the liquid and all the liquid changes state to gas as a metal is heated to its melting point the metallic bonds keeping the atoms in place weaken so that the atoms can move around and the metallic bonds eventually break completely at the metals boiling point therefore the falling melting and boiling points of the alkali metals indicate that the strength of the metallic bonds of the alkali metals decreases down the group this is because metal atoms are held together by the electromagnetic attraction from the positive ions to the delocalised electrons as the atoms increase in size going down the group because their atomic radius increases the nuclei of the ions move further away from the delocalised electrons and hence the metallic bond becomes weaker so that the metal can more easily melt and boil thus lowering the melting and boiling points the increased nuclear charge is not a relevant factor due to the shielding effect density the alkali metals all have the same crystal structure bodycentred cubic and thus the only relevant factors are the number of atoms that can fit into a certain volume and the mass of one of the atoms since density is defined as mass per unit volume the first factor depends on the volume of the atom and thus the atomic radius which increases going down the group thus the volume of an alkali metal atom increases going down the group the mass of an alkali metal atom also increases going down the group thus the trend for the densities of the alkali metals depends on their atomic weights and atomic radii if figures for these two factors are known the ratios between the densities of the alkali metals can then be calculated the resultant trend is that the densities of the alkali metals increase down the table with an exception at potassium due to having the lowest atomic weight of all the elements in their period and having the largest atomic radius for their periods the alkali metals are the least dense metals in the periodic table lithium sodium and potassium are the only three metals in the periodic table that are less dense than water in fact lithium is the least dense known solid at room temperature
60,in the solar system estimated abundances of the chemical elements in the solar system hydrogen and helium are most common from the big bang the next three elements lithium beryllium and boron are rare because they are poorly synthesised in the big bang and also in stars the two general trends in the remaining stellarproduced elements are 1 an alternation of abundance in elements as they have even or odd atomic numbers and 2 a general decrease in abundance as elements become heavier iron is especially common because it represents the minimum energy nuclide that can be made by fusion of helium in supernovae the oddoharkins rule holds that elements with even atomic numbers are more common that those with odd atomic numbers with the exception of hydrogen this rule argues that elements with odd atomic numbers have one unpaired proton and are more likely to capture another thus increasing their atomic number in elements with even atomic numbers protons are paired with each member of the pair offsetting the spin of the other enhancing stability all the alkali metals have odd atomic numbers and they are not as common as the elements with even atomic numbers adjacent to them the noble gases and the alkaline earth metals in the solar system the heavier alkali metals are also less abundant than the lighter ones as the alkali metals from rubidium onward can only be synthesised in supernovae and not in stellar nucleosynthesis lithium is also much less abundant than sodium and potassium as it is poorly synthesised in both big bang nucleosynthesis and in stars the big bang could only produce trace quantities of lithium beryllium and boron due to the absence of a stable nucleus with 5 or 8 nucleons and stellar nucleosynthesis could only pass this bottleneck by the triplealpha process fusing three helium nuclei to form carbon and skipping over those three elements on earth spodumene an important lithium mineral the earth formed from the same cloud of matter that formed the sun but the planets acquired different compositions during the formation and evolution of the solar system in turn the natural history of the earth caused parts of this planet to have differing concentrations of the elements the mass of the earth is approximately 598 kg it is composed mostly of iron 321 oxygen 301 silicon 151 magnesium 139 sulfur 29 nickel 18 calcium 15 and aluminium 14 with the remaining 12 consisting of trace amounts of other elements due to planetary differentiation the core region is believed to be primarily composed of iron 888 with smaller amounts of nickel 58 sulfur 45 and less than 1 trace elements the alkali metals due to their high reactivity do not occur naturally in pure form in nature they are lithophiles and therefore remain close to the earths surface because they combine readily with oxygen and so associate strongly with silica forming relatively lowdensity minerals that do not sink down into the earths core potassium rubidium and caesium are also incompatible elements due to their large ionic radii sodium and potassium are very abundant in earth both being among the ten most common elements in earths crust sodium makes up approximately 26 of the earths crust measured by weight making it the sixth most abundant element overall and the most abundant alkali metal potassium makes up approximately 15 of the earths crust and is the seventh most abundant element sodium is found in many different minerals of which the most common is ordinary salt sodium chloride which occurs in vast quantities dissolved in seawater other solid deposits include halite amphibole cryolite nitratine and zeolite many of these solid deposits occur as a result of ancient seas evaporating which still occurs now in places such as utahs great salt lake and the dead sea despite their nearequal abundance in earths crust sodium is far more common than potassium in the ocean both because potassiums larger size makes its salts less soluble and because potassium is bound by silicates in soil and what potassium leaches is absorbed far more readily by plant life than sodium despite its chemical similarity lithium typically does not occur together with sodium or potassium due to its smaller size due to its relatively low reactivity it can be found in seawater in large amounts it is estimated that seawater is approximately 014 to 025 parts per million ppm or 25 micromolar its diagonal relationship with magnesium often allows it to replace magnesium in ferromagnesium minerals where its crustal concentration is about 18 ppm comparable to that of gallium and niobium commercially the most important lithium mineral is spodumene which occurs in large deposits worldwide rubidium is approximately as abundant as zinc and more abundant than copper it occurs naturally in the minerals leucite pollucite carnallite zinnwaldite and lepidolite although none of these contain only rubidium and no other alkali metals caesium is more abundant than some commonly known elements such as antimony cadmium tin and tungsten but is much less abundant than rubidium francium223 the only naturally occurring isotope of francium is the product of the alpha decay of actinium227 and can be found in trace amounts in uranium minerals in a given sample of uranium there is estimated to be only one francium atom for every 1018 uranium atoms it has been calculated that there is at most 30 g of francium in the earths crust at any time due to its extremely short halflife of 22 minutes
61,the english word alphabet came into middle english from the late latin word alphabetum which in turn originated in the greek ἀλφάβητος alphabētos the greek word was made from the first two letters alpha and beta the names for the greek letters came from the first two letters of the phoenician alphabet aleph which also meant ox and bet which also meant house sometimes like in the alphabet song in english the term abcs is used instead of the word alphabet now i know my abcs knowing ones abcs in general can be used as a metaphor for knowing the basics about anything
61,when an alphabet is adopted or developed to represent a given language an orthography generally comes into being providing rules for the spelling of words in that language in accordance with the principle on which alphabets are based these rules will generally map letters of the alphabet to the phonemes significant sounds of the spoken language in a perfectly phonemic orthography there would be a consistent onetoone correspondence between the letters and the phonemes so that a writer could predict the spelling of a word given its pronunciation and a speaker would always know the pronunciation of a word given its spelling and vice versa however this ideal is not usually achieved in practice some languages such as spanish and finnish come close to it while others such as english deviate from it to a much larger degree the pronunciation of a language often evolves independently of its writing system and writing systems have been borrowed for languages they were not designed for so the degree to which letters of an alphabet correspond to phonemes of a language varies greatly from one language to another and even within a single language languages may fail to achieve a onetoone correspondence between letters and sounds in any of several ways a language may represent a given phoneme by a combination of letters rather than just a single letter twoletter combinations are called digraphs and threeletter groups are called trigraphs german uses the tetragraphs four letters tsch for the phoneme and in a few borrowed words dsch for kabardian also uses a tetragraph for one of its phonemes namely кхъу two letters representing one sound occur in several instances in hungarian as well where for instance cs stands for tʃ sz for s zs for ʒ dzs for dʒ a language may represent the same phoneme with two or more different letters or combinations of letters an example is modern greek which may write the phoneme in six different ways and though the last is rare a language may spell some words with unpronounced letters that exist for historical or other reasons for example the spelling of the thai word for beer เบยร retains a letter for the final consonant r present in the english word it was borrowed from but silences it pronunciation of individual words may change according to the presence of surrounding words in a sentence sandhi different dialects of a language may use different phonemes for the same word a language may use different sets of symbols or different rules for distinct sets of vocabulary items such as the japanese hiragana and katakana syllabaries or the various rules in english for spelling words from latin and greek or the original germanic vocabulary national languages sometimes elect to address the problem of dialects by simply associating the alphabet with the national standard however with an international language with wide variations in its dialects such as english it would be impossible to represent the language in all its variations with a single phonetic alphabet some national languages like finnish turkish russian serbocroatian serbian croatian and bosnian and bulgarian have a very regular spelling system with a nearly onetoone correspondence between letters and phonemes strictly speaking these national languages lack a word corresponding to the verb to spell meaning to split a word into its letters the closest match being a verb meaning to split a word into its syllables similarly the italian verb corresponding to spell out compitare is unknown to many italians because spelling is usually trivial as italian spelling is highly phonemic in standard spanish one can tell the pronunciation of a word from its spelling but not vice versa as certain phonemes can be represented in more than one way but a given letter is consistently pronounced french with its silent letters and its heavy use of nasal vowels and elision may seem to lack much correspondence between spelling and pronunciation but its rules on pronunciation though complex are actually consistent and predictable with a fair degree of accuracy at the other extreme are languages such as english where the pronunciations of many words simply have to be memorized as they do not correspond to the spelling in a consistent way for english this is partly because the great vowel shift occurred after the orthography was established and because english has acquired a large number of loanwords at different times retaining their original spelling at varying levels even english has general albeit complex rules that predict pronunciation from spelling and these rules are successful most of the time rules to predict spelling from the pronunciation have a higher failure rate sometimes countries have the written language undergo a spelling reform to realign the writing with the contemporary spoken language these can range from simple spelling changes and word forms to switching the entire writing system itself as when turkey switched from the arabic alphabet to a latinbased turkish alphabet the standard system of symbols used by linguists to represent sounds in any language independently of orthography is called the international phonetic alphabet

61,a specimen of typeset fonts and languages by william caslon letter founder from the 1728 cyclopaedia ancient northeast african and middle eastern scripts the history of the alphabet started in ancient egypt egyptian writing had a set of some 24 hieroglyphs that are called uniliterals to represent syllables that begin with a single consonant of their language plus a vowel or no vowel to be supplied by the native speaker these glyphs were used as pronunciation guides for logograms to write grammatical inflections and later to transcribe loan words and foreign names a specimen of protosinaitic script one of the earliest if not the very first phonemic scripts in the middle bronze age an apparently alphabetic system known as the protosinaitic script appears in egyptian turquoise mines in the sinai peninsula dated to circa the 15th century bc apparently left by canaanite workers in 1999 john and deborah darnell discovered an even earlier version of this first alphabet at wadi elhol dated to circa 1800 bc and showing evidence of having been adapted from specific forms of egyptian hieroglyphs that could be dated to circa 2000 bc strongly suggesting that the first alphabet had been developed about that time based on letter appearances and names it is believed to be based on egyptian hieroglyphs this script had no characters representing vowels although originally it probably was a syllabary but unneeded symbols were discarded an alphabetic cuneiform script with 30 signs including three that indicate the following vowel was invented in ugarit before the 15th century bc this script was not used after the destruction of ugarit the protosinaitic script eventually developed into the phoenician alphabet which is conventionally called protocanaanite before ca 1050 bc the oldest text in phoenician script is an inscription on the sarcophagus of king ahiram this script is the parent script of all western alphabets by the tenth century two other forms can be distinguished namely canaanite and aramaic the aramaic gave rise to the hebrew script the south arabian alphabet a sister script to the phoenician alphabet is the script from which the geez alphabet an abugida is descended vowelless alphabets which are not true alphabets are called abjads currently exemplified in scripts including arabic hebrew and syriac the omission of vowels was not always a satisfactory solution and some weak consonants are sometimes used to indicate the vowel quality of a syllable matres lectionis these letters have a dual function since they are also used as pure consonants the protosinaitic or protocanaanite script and the ugaritic script were the first scripts with a limited number of signs in contrast to the other widely used writing systems at the time cuneiform egyptian hieroglyphs and linear b the phoenician script was probably the first phonemic script and it contained only about two dozen distinct letters making it a script simple enough for common traders to learn another advantage of phoenician was that it could be used to write down many different languages since it recorded words phonemically the script was spread by the phoenicians across the mediterranean in greece the script was modified to add the vowels giving rise to the ancestor of all alphabets in the west the vowels have independent letter forms separate from the consonants therefore it was the first true alphabet the greeks chose letters representing sounds that did not exist in greek to represent the vowels the vowels are significant in the greek language and the syllabical linear b script that was used by the mycenaean greeks from the 16th century bc had 87 symbols including 5 vowels in its early years there were many variants of the greek alphabet a situation that caused many different alphabets to evolve from it european alphabets codex zographensis in the glagolitic alphabet from medieval bulgaria the greek alphabet in its euboean form was carried over by greek colonists to the italian peninsula where it gave rise to a variety of alphabets used to write the italic languages one of these became the latin alphabet which was spread across europe as the romans expanded their empire even after the fall of the roman state the alphabet survived in intellectual and religious works it eventually became used for the descendant languages of latin the romance languages and then for most of the other languages of europe some adaptations of the latin alphabet are augmented with ligatures such as æ in danish and icelandic and ȣ in algonquian by borrowings from other alphabets such as the thorn þ in old english and icelandic which came from the futhark runes and by modifying existing letters such as the eth ð of old english and icelandic which is a modified d other alphabets only use a subset of the latin alphabet such as hawaiian and italian which uses the letters j k x y and w only in foreign words another notable script is elder futhark which is believed to have evolved out of one of the old italic alphabets elder futhark gave rise to a variety of alphabets known collectively as the runic alphabets the runic alphabets were used for germanic languages from ad 100 to the late middle ages its usage is mostly restricted to engravings on stone and jewelry although inscriptions have also been found on bone and wood these alphabets have since been replaced with the latin alphabet except for decorative usage for which the runes remained in use until the 20th century the old hungarian script is a contemporary writing system of the hungarians it was in use during the entire history of hungary albeit not as an official writing system from the 19th century it once again became more and more popular the glagolitic alphabet was the initial script of the liturgical language old church slavonic and became together with the greek uncial script the basis of the cyrillic script cyrillic is one of the most widely used modern alphabetic scripts and is notable for its use in slavic languages and also for other languages within the former soviet union cyrillic alphabets include the serbian macedonian bulgarian russian belarusian and ukrainian the glagolitic alphabet is believed to have been created by saints cyril and methodius while the cyrillic alphabet was invented by clement of ohrid who was their disciple they feature many letters that appear to have been borrowed from or influenced by the greek alphabet and the hebrew alphabet the longest european alphabet is the slovak alphabet which has 46 letters asian alphabets beyond the logographic chinese writing many phonetic scripts are in existence in asia the arabic alphabet hebrew alphabet syriac alphabet and other abjads of the middle east are developments of the aramaic alphabet but because these writing systems are largely consonantbased they are often not considered true alphabets most alphabetic scripts of india and eastern asia are descended from the brahmi script which is often believed to be a descendant of aramaic zhuyin on a cell phone in korea the hangul alphabet was created by sejong the great hangul is a unique alphabet it is a featural alphabet where many of the letters are designed from a sounds place of articulation p to look like the widened mouth l to look like the tongue pulled in etc its design was planned by the government of the day and it places individual letters in syllable clusters with equal dimensions in the same way as chinese characters to allow for mixedscript writing one syllable always takes up one typespace no matter how many letters get stacked into building that one soundblock zhuyin sometimes called bopomofo is a semisyllabary used to phonetically transcribe mandarin chinese in the republic of china after the later establishment of the peoples republic of china and its adoption of hanyu pinyin the use of zhuyin today is limited but it is still widely used in taiwan where the republic of china still governs zhuyin developed out of a form of chinese shorthand based on chinese characters in the early 1900s and has elements of both an alphabet and a syllabary like an alphabet the phonemes of syllable initials are represented by individual symbols but like a syllabary the phonemes of the syllable finals are not rather each possible final excluding the medial glide is represented by its own symbol for example luan is represented as ㄌㄨㄢ luan where the last symbol ㄢ represents the entire final an while zhuyin is not used as a mainstream writing system it is still often used in ways similar to a romanization systemthat is for aiding in pronunciation and as an input method for chinese characters on computers and cellphones european alphabets especially latin and cyrillic have been adapted for many languages of asia arabic is also widely used sometimes as an abjad as with urdu and persian and sometimes as a complete alphabet as with kurdish and uyghur

61,the term alphabet is used by linguists and paleographers in both a wide and a narrow sense in the wider sense an alphabet is a script that is segmental at the phoneme levelthat is it has separate glyphs for individual sounds and not for larger units such as syllables or words in the narrower sense some scholars distinguish true alphabets from two other types of segmental script abjads and abugidas these three differ from each other in the way they treat vowels abjads have letters for consonants and leave most vowels unexpressed abugidas are also consonantbased but indicate vowels with diacritics to or a systematic graphic modification of the consonants in alphabets in the narrow sense on the other hand consonants and vowels are written as independent letters the earliest known alphabet in the wider sense is the wadi elhol script believed to be an abjad which through its successor phoenician is the ancestor of modern alphabets including arabic greek latin via the old italic alphabet cyrillic via the greek alphabet and hebrew via aramaic examples of presentday abjads are the arabic and hebrew scripts true alphabets include latin cyrillic and korean hangul and abugidas are used to write tigrinya amharic hindi and thai the canadian aboriginal syllabics are also an abugida rather than a syllabary as their name would imply since each glyph stands for a consonant that is modified by rotation to represent the following vowel in a true syllabary each consonantvowel combination would be represented by a separate glyph all three types may be augmented with syllabic glyphs ugaritic for example is basically an abjad but has syllabic letters for these are the only time vowels are indicated cyrillic is basically a true alphabet but has syllabic letters for я е ю coptic has a letter for devanagari is typically an abugida augmented with dedicated letters for initial vowels though some traditions use अ as a zero consonant as the graphic base for such vowels the boundaries between the three types of segmental scripts are not always clearcut for example sorani kurdish is written in the arabic script which is normally an abjad however in kurdish writing the vowels is mandatory and full letters are used so the script is a true alphabet other languages may use a semitic abjad with mandatory vowel diacritics effectively making them abugidas on the other hand the phagspa script of the mongol empire was based closely on the tibetan abugida but all vowel marks were written after the preceding consonant rather than as diacritic marks although short a was not written as in the indic abugidas one could argue that the linear arrangement made this a true alphabet conversely the vowel marks of the tigrinya abugida and the amharic abugida ironically the original source of the term abugida have been so completely assimilated into their consonants that the modifications are no longer systematic and have to be learned as a syllabary rather than as a segmental script even more extreme the pahlavi abjad eventually became logographic see below geez script of ethiopia and eritrea thus the primary classification of alphabets reflects how they treat vowels for tonal languages further classification can be based on their treatment of tone though names do not yet exist to distinguish the various types some alphabets disregard tone entirely especially when it does not carry a heavy functional load as in somali and many other languages of africa and the americas such scripts are to tone what abjads are to vowels most commonly tones are indicated with diacritics the way vowels are treated in abugidas this is the case for vietnamese a true alphabet and thai an abugida in thai tone is determined primarily by the choice of consonant with diacritics for disambiguation in the pollard script an abugida vowels are indicated by diacritics but the placement of the diacritic relative to the consonant is modified to indicate the tone more rarely a script may have separate letters for tones as is the case for hmong and zhuang for most of these scripts regardless of whether letters or diacritics are used the most common tone is not marked just as the most common vowel is not marked in indic abugidas in zhuyin not only is one of the tones unmarked but there is a diacritic to indicate lack of tone like the virama of indic the number of letters in an alphabet can be quite small the book pahlavi script an abjad had only twelve letters at one point and may have had even fewer later on today the rotokas alphabet has only twelve letters the hawaiian alphabet is sometimes claimed to be as small but it actually consists of 18 letters including the ʻokina and five long vowels however hawaiian braille has only 13 letters while rotokas has a small alphabet because it has few phonemes to represent just eleven book pahlavi was small because many letters had been conflatedthat is the graphic distinctions had been lost over time and diacritics were not developed to compensate for this as they were in arabic another script that lost many of its distinct letter shapes for example a commashaped letter represented g d y k or j however such apparent simplifications can perversely make a script more complicated in later pahlavi papyri up to half of the remaining graphic distinctions of these twelve letters were lost and the script could no longer be read as a sequence of letters at all but instead each word had to be learned as a wholethat is they had become logograms as in egyptian demotic greek cyrillic and latin alphabets which share many of the same letters although they have different pronunciations the largest segmental script is probably an abugida devanagari when written in devanagari vedic sanskrit has an alphabet of 53 letters including the visarga mark for final aspiration and special letters for kš and jñ though one of the letters is theoretical and not actually used the hindi alphabet must represent both sanskrit and modern vocabulary and so has been expanded to 58 with the khutma letters letters with a dot added to represent sounds from persian and english thai has a total of 59 symbols consisting of 44 consonants 13 vowels and 2 syllabics not including 4 diacritics for tone marks and one for vowel length the largest known abjad is sindhi with 51 letters the largest alphabets in the narrow sense include kabardian and abkhaz for cyrillic with 58 and 56 letters respectively and slovak for the latin script with 46 however these scripts either count di and trigraphs as separate letters as spanish did with ch and ll until recently or uses diacritics like slovak č the georgian alphabet is alphabetical writing system it is the largest true alphabet where each letter is graphically independent with 33 letters original georgian alphabet had 38 letters but 5 letters were removed in 19th century by ilia chavchavadze the georgian alphabet is much closer to greek than the other caucasian alphabets the numeric value runs parallel to the greek one the consonants without a greek equivalent are organized at the end of the alphabet origins of the alphabet are still unknown some armenian and western scholars believe it was created by mesrop mashtots armenian մեսրոպ մաշտոց mesrop maštocalso known as mesrob the vartabedwho was an early medieval armenian linguist theologian statesman and hymnologist best known for inventing the armenian alphabet c 405 ad other georgian and western scholars are against this theory syllabaries typically contain 50 to 400 glyphs and the glyphs of logographic systems typically number from the many hundreds into the thousands thus a simple count of the number of distinct symbols is an important clue to the nature of an unknown script the armenian alphabet or is a graphically unique alphabetical writing system that has been used to write the armenian language it was introduced by mesrob mashdots around 405 ad an armenian linguist and ecclesiastical leader and originally contained 36 letters two more letters օ o and ֆ f were added in the middle ages during the 1920s orthography reform a new letter և capital եվ was added which was a ligature before եւ while the letter ւ ւ was discarded and reintroduced as part of a new letter ու ու which was a digraph before old georgian alphabet inscription on monastery

62,an explanation of the superscripts and subscripts seen in atomic number notation atomic number is the number of protons and therefore also the total positive charge in the atomic nucleus the rutherfordbohr model of the hydrogen atom or a hydrogenlike ion in this model it is an essential feature that the photon energy or frequency of the electromagnetic radiation emitted shown when an electron jumps from one orbital to another be proportional to the mathematical square of atomic charge experimental measurement by henry moseley of this radiation for many elements from showed the results as predicted by bohr both the concept of atomic number and the bohr model were thereby given scientific credence the atomic number or proton number symbol z of a chemical element is the number of protons found in the nucleus of an atom it is identical to the charge number of the nucleus the atomic number uniquely identifies a chemical element in an uncharged atom the atomic number is also equal to the number of electrons the sum of the atomic number z and the number of neutrons n gives the mass number a of an atom since protons and neutrons have approximately the same mass and the mass of the electrons is negligible for many purposes and the mass defect of nucleon binding is always small compared to the nucleon mass the atomic mass of any atom when expressed in unified atomic mass units making a quantity called the relative isotopic mass is within 1 of the whole number a atoms with the same atomic number z but different neutron numbers n and hence different atomic masses are known as isotopes a little more than threequarters of naturally occurring elements exist as a mixture of isotopes see monoisotopic elements and the average isotopic mass of an isotopic mixture for an element called the relative atomic mass in a defined environment on earth determines the elements standard atomic weight historically it was these atomic weights of elements in comparison to hydrogen that were the quantities measurable by chemists in the 19th century the conventional symbol z comes from the german word meaning number which prior to the modern synthesis of ideas from chemistry and physics merely denoted an elements numerical place in the periodic table whose order is approximately but not completely consistent with the order of the elements by atomic weights only after 1915 with the suggestion and evidence that this z number was also the nuclear charge and a physical characteristic of atoms did the word and its english equivalent atomic number come into common use in this context
62,the quest for new elements is usually described using atomic numbers as of 2010 all elements with atomic numbers 1 to 118 have been observed synthesis of new elements is accomplished by bombarding target atoms of heavy elements with ions such that the sum of the atomic numbers of the target and ion elements equals the atomic number of the element being created in general the halflife becomes shorter as atomic number increases though an island of stability may exist for undiscovered isotopes with certain numbers of protons and neutrons

62,each element has a specific set of chemical properties as a consequence of the number of electrons present in the neutral atom which is z the atomic number the configuration of these electrons follows from the principles of quantum mechanics the number of electrons in each elements electron shells particularly the outermost valence shell is the primary factor in determining its chemical bonding behavior hence it is the atomic number alone that determines the chemical properties of an element and it is for this reason that an element can be defined as consisting of any mixture of atoms with a given atomic number
62,history of the periodic table effective atomic number atomic theory prouts hypothesis
62,the conventional symbol z possibly comes from the german word atomic number however prior to 1915 the word zahl simply number was used for an elements assigned number in the periodic table
62,the periodic table and a natural number for each element russian chemist dmitri mendeleev created a periodic table of the elements that ordered them numerically by atomic weight yet occasionally used chemical properties in contradiction to weight loosely speaking the existence or construction of a periodic table of elements creates an ordering of the elements and so they can be numbered in order dmitri mendeleev claimed that he arranged his first periodic tables in order of atomic weight atomgewicht however in consideration of the elements observed chemical properties he changed the order slightly and placed tellurium atomic weight 1276 ahead of iodine atomic weight 1269 this placement is consistent with the modern practice of ordering the elements by proton number z but that number was not known or suspected at the time a simple numbering based on periodic table position was never entirely satisfactory however besides the case of iodine and tellurium later several other pairs of elements such as argon and potassium cobalt and nickel were known to have nearly identical or reversed atomic weights thus requiring their placement in the periodic table to be determined by their chemical properties however the gradual identification of more and more chemically similar lanthanide elements whose atomic number was not obvious led to inconsistency and uncertainty in the periodic numbering of elements at least from lutetium element 71 onwards hafnium was not known at this time niels bohrs 1913 bohr model of the atom required van den broeks atomic number of nuclear charges and bohr believed that moseleys work contributed greatly to the acceptance of the model henry moseley helped develop the concept of atomic number by showing experimentally 1913 that van den broeks 1911 hypothesis combined with the bohr model nearly correctly predicted atomic xray emissions the rutherfordbohr model and van den broek in 1911 ernest rutherford gave a model of the atom in which a central core held most of the atoms mass and a positive charge which in units of the electrons charge was to be approximately equal to half of the atoms atomic weight expressed in numbers of hydrogen atoms this central charge would thus be approximately half the atomic weight though it was almost 25 different from the atomic number of gold the single element from which rutherford made his guess nevertheless in spite of rutherfords estimation that gold had a central charge of about 100 but was element on the periodic table a month after rutherfords paper appeared antonius van den broek first formally suggested that the central charge and number of electrons in an atom was exactly equal to its place in the periodic table also known as element number atomic number and symbolized z this proved eventually to be the case moseleys 1913 experiment the experimental position improved dramatically after research by henry moseley in 1913 moseley after discussions with bohr who was at the same lab and who had used van den broeks hypothesis in his bohr model of the atom decided to test van den broeks and bohrs hypothesis directly by seeing if spectral lines emitted from excited atoms fitted the bohr theorys postulation that the frequency of the spectral lines be proportional to the square of z to do this moseley measured the wavelengths of the innermost photon transitions k and l lines produced by the elements from aluminum z 13 to gold z 79 used as a series of movable anodic targets inside an xray tube the square root of the frequency of these photons xrays increased from one target to the next in an arithmetic progression this led to the conclusion moseleys law that the atomic number does closely correspond with an offset of one unit for klines in moseleys work to the calculated electric charge of the nucleus ie the element number z among other things moseley demonstrated that the lanthanide series from lanthanum to lutetium inclusive must have 15 membersno fewer and no morewhich was far from obvious from the chemistry at that time missing elements after moseleys death in 1915 the atomic numbers of all known elements from hydrogen to uranium z 92 were examined by his method there were seven elements with z 92 which were not found and therefore identified as still undiscovered corresponding to atomic numbers 43 61 72 75 85 87 and 91 from 1918 to 1947 all seven of these missing elements were discovered by this time the first four transuranium elements had also been discovered so that the periodic table was complete with no gaps as far as curium z 96 the proton and the idea of nuclear electrons in 1915 the reason for nuclear charge being quantized in units of z which were now recognized to be the same as the element number was not understood an old idea called prouts hypothesis had postulated that the elements were all made of residues or protyles of the lightest element hydrogen which in the bohrrutherford model had a single electron and a nuclear charge of one however as early as 1907 rutherford and thomas royds had shown that alpha particles which had a charge of 2 were the nuclei of helium atoms which had a mass four times that of hydrogen not two times if prouts hypothesis were true something had to be neutralizing some of the charge of the hydrogen nuclei present in the nuclei of heavier atoms in 1917 rutherford succeeded in generating hydrogen nuclei from a nuclear reaction between alpha particles and nitrogen gas and believed he had proven prouts law he called the new heavy nuclear particles protons in 1920 alternate names being proutons and protyles it had been immediately apparent from the work of moseley that the nuclei of heavy atoms have more than twice as much mass as would be expected from their being made of hydrogen nuclei and thus there was required a hypothesis for the neutralization of the extra protons presumed present in all heavy nuclei a helium nucleus was presumed to be composed of four protons plus two nuclear electrons electrons bound inside the nucleus to cancel two of the charges at the other end of the periodic table a nucleus of gold with a mass 197 times that of hydrogen was thought to contain 118 nuclear electrons in the nucleus to give it a residual charge of 79 consistent with its atomic number the discovery of the neutron makes z the proton number all consideration of nuclear electrons ended with james chadwicks discovery of the neutron in 1932 an atom of gold now was seen as containing 118 neutrons rather than 118 nuclear electrons and its positive charge now was realized to come entirely from a content of 79 protons after 1932 therefore an elements atomic number z was also realized to be identical to the proton number of its nuclei

sessile lifestyle most animals have bodies differentiated into separate tissues and these animals are also known as eumetazoans they have an internal digestive chamber with one or two openings the gametes are produced in multicellular sex organs and the zygotes include a blastula stage in their embryonic development metazoans do not include the sponges which have undifferentiated cells unlike plant cells animal cells have neither a cell wall nor chloroplasts vacuoles when present are more in number and much smaller than those in the plant cell the body tissues are composed of numerous types of cell including those found in muscles nerves and skin each typically has a cell membrane formed of phospholipids cytoplasm and a nucleus all of the different cells of an animal are derived from the embryonic germ layers those simpler invertebrates which are formed from two germ layers of ectoderm and endoderm are called diploblastic and the more developed animals whose structures and organs are formed from three germ layers are called triploblastic all of a triploblastic animals tissues and organs are derived from the three germ layers of the embryo the ectoderm mesoderm and endoderm animal tissues can be grouped into four basic types connective epithelial muscle and nervous tissue hyaline cartilage at high magnification he stain connective tissue connective tissues are fibrous and made up of cells scattered among inorganic material called the extracellular matrix connective tissue gives shape to organs and holds them in place the main types are loose connective tissue adipose tissue fibrous connective tissue cartilage and bone the extracellular matrix contains proteins the chief and most abundant of which is collagen collagen plays a major part in organizing and maintaining tissues the matrix can be modified to form a skeleton to support or protect the body an exoskeleton is a thickened rigid cuticle which is stiffened by mineralization as in crustaceans or by the crosslinking of its proteins as in insects an endoskeleton is internal and present in all developed animals as well as in many of those less developed epithelium gastric mucosa at low magnification he stain epithelial tissue is composed of closely packed cells bound to each other by cell adhesion molecules with little intercellular space epithelial cells can be squamous flat cuboidal or columnar and rest on a basal lamina the upper layer of the basement membrane the lower layer is the reticular lamina lying next to the connective tissue in the extracellular matrix secreted by the epithelial cells there are many different types of epithelium modified to suit a particular function in the respiratory tract there is a type of ciliated epithelial lining in the small intestine there are microvilli on the epithelial lining and in the large intestine there are intestinal villi skin consists of an outer layer of keratinized stratified squamous epithelium that covers the exterior of the vertebrate body keratinocytes make up to 95 of the cells in the skin the epithelial cells on the external surface of the body typically secrete an extracellular matrix in the form of a cuticle in simple animals this may just be a coat of glycoproteins in more advanced animals many glands are formed of epithelial cells muscle tissue cross section through skeletal muscle and a small nerve at high magnification he stain muscle cells myocytes form the active contractile tissue of the body muscle tissue functions to produce force and cause motion either locomotion or movement within internal organs muscle is formed of contractile filaments and is separated into three main types smooth muscle skeletal muscle and cardiac muscle smooth muscle has no striations when examined microscopically it contracts slowly but maintains contractibility over a wide range of stretch lengths it is found in such organs as sea anemone tentacles and the body wall of sea cucumbers skeletal muscle contracts rapidly but has a limited range of extension it is found in the movement of appendages and jaws obliquely striated muscle is intermediate between the other two the filaments are staggered and this is the type of muscle found in earthworms that can extend slowly or make rapid contractions in higher animals striated muscles occur in bundles attached to bone to provide movement and are often arranged in antagonistic sets smooth muscle is found in the walls of the uterus bladder intestines stomach oesophagus respiratory airways and blood vessels cardiac muscle is found only in the heart allowing it to contract and pump blood round the body nervous tissue nervous tissue is composed of many nerve cells known as neurons which transmit information in some slowmoving radially symmetrical marine animals such as ctenophores and cnidarians including sea anemones and jellyfish the nerves form a nerve net but in most animals they are organized longitudinally into bundles in simple animals receptor neurons in the body wall cause a local reaction to a stimulus in more complex animals specialized receptor cells such as chemoreceptors and photoreceptors are found in groups and send messages along neural networks to other parts of the organism neurons can be connected together in ganglia in higher animals specialized receptors are the basis of sense organs and there is a central nervous system brain and spinal cord and a peripheral nervous system the latter consists of sensory nerves that transmit information from sense organs and motor nerves that influence target organs the peripheral nervous system is divided into the somatic nervous system which conveys sensation and controls voluntary muscle and the autonomic nervous system which involuntarily controls smooth muscle certain glands and internal organs including the stomach
63,superficial or surface anatomy is important as the study of anatomical landmarks that can be readily seen from the exterior contours of the body it enables physicians or veterinary surgeons to gauge the position and anatomy of the associated deeper structures superficial is a directional term that indicates that structures are located relatively close to the surface of the body comparative anatomy relates to the comparison of anatomical structures both gross and microscopic in different animals artistic anatomy relates to anatomic studies for artistic reasons
63,head of a male daphnia a planktonic crustacean invertebrates constitute a vast array of living organisms ranging from the simplest unicellular eukaryotes such as paramecium to such complex multicellular animals as the octopus lobster and dragonfly they constitute about 95 of the animal species by definition none of these creatures has a backbone the cells of singlecell protozoans have the same basic structure as those of multicellular animals but some parts are specialized into the equivalent of tissues and organs locomotion is often provided by cilia or flagella or may proceed via the advance of pseudopodia food may be gathered by phagocytosis energy needs may be supplied by photosynthesis and the cell may be supported by an endoskeleton or an exoskeleton some protozoans can form multicellular colonies metazoans are multicellular organism different groups of cells of which have separate functions the most basic types of metazoan tissues are epithelium and connective tissue both of which are present in nearly all invertebrates the outer surface of the epidermis is normally formed of epithelial cells and secretes an extracellular matrix which provides support to the organism an endoskeleton derived from the mesoderm is present in echinoderms sponges and some cephalopods exoskeletons are derived from the epidermis and is composed of chitin in arthropods insects spiders ticks shrimps crabs lobsters calcium carbonate constitutes the shells of molluscs brachiopods and some tubebuilding polychaete worms and silica forms the exoskeleton of the microscopic diatoms and radiolaria other invertebrates may have no rigid structures but the epidermis may secrete a variety of surface coatings such as the pinacoderm of sponges the gelatinous cuticle of cnidarians polyps sea anemones jellyfish and the collagenous cuticle of annelids the outer epithelial layer may include cells of several types including sensory cells gland cells and stinging cells there may also be protrusions such as microvilli cilia bristles spines and tubercles marcello malpighi the father of microscopical anatomy discovered that plants had tubules similar to those he saw in insects like the silk worm he observed that when a ringlike portion of bark was removed on a trunk a swelling occurred in the tissues above the ring and he unmistakably interpreted this as growth stimulated by food coming down from the leaves and being captured above the ring arthropod anatomy arthropods comprise the largest phylum in the animal kingdom with over a million known invertebrate species insects possess segmented bodies supported by a hardjointed outer covering the exoskeleton made mostly of chitin the segments of the body are organized into three distinct parts a head a thorax and an abdomen the head typically bears a pair of sensory antennae a pair of compound eyes one to three simple eyes ocelli and three sets of modified appendages that form the mouthparts the thorax has three pairs of segmented legs one pair each for the three segments that compose the thorax and one or two pairs of wings the abdomen is composed of eleven segments some of which may be fused and houses the digestive respiratory excretory and reproductive systems there is considerable variation between species and many adaptations to the body parts especially wings legs antennae and mouthparts spiders a class of arachnids have four pairs of legs a body of two segmentsa cephalothorax and an abdomen spiders have no wings and no antennae they have mouthparts called chelicerae which are often connected to venom glands as most spiders are venomous they have a second pair of appendages called pedipalps attached to the cephalothorax these have similar segmentation to the legs and function as taste and smell organs at the end of each male pedipalp is a spoonshaped cymbium that acts to support the copulatory organ

63,mouse skull all vertebrates have a similar basic body plan and at some point in their lives mostly in the embryonic stage share the major chordate characteristics a stiffening rod the notochord a dorsal hollow tube of nervous material the neural tube pharyngeal arches and a tail posterior to the anus the spinal cord is protected by the vertebral column and is above the notochord and the gastrointestinal tract is below it nervous tissue is derived from the ectoderm connective tissues are derived from mesoderm and gut is derived from the endoderm at the posterior end is a tail which continues the spinal cord and vertebrae but not the gut the mouth is found at the anterior end of the animal and the anus at the base of the tail the defining characteristic of a vertebrate is the vertebral column formed in the development of the segmented series of vertebrae in most vertebrates the notochord becomes the nucleus pulposus of the intervertebral discs however a few vertebrates such as the sturgeon and the coelacanth retain the notochord into adulthood jawed vertebrates are typified by paired appendages fins or legs which may be secondarily lost the limbs of vertebrates are considered to be homologous because the same underlying skeletal structure was inherited from their last common ancestor this is one of the arguments put forward by charles darwin to support his theory of evolution fish anatomy cutaway diagram showing various organs of a fish the body of a fish is divided into a head trunk and tail although the divisions between the three are not always externally visible the skeleton which forms the support structure inside the fish is either made of cartilage in cartilaginous fish or bone in bony fish the main skeletal element is the vertebral column composed of articulating vertebrae which are lightweight yet strong the ribs attach to the spine and there are no limbs or limb girdles the main external features of the fish the fins are composed of either bony or soft spines called rays which with the exception of the caudal fins have no direct connection with the spine they are supported by the muscles which compose the main part of the trunk the heart has two chambers and pumps the blood through the respiratory surfaces of the gills and on round the body in a single circulatory loop the eyes are adapted for seeing underwater and have only local vision there is an inner ear but no external or middle ear low frequency vibrations are detected by the lateral line system of sense organs that run along the length of the sides of fish and these respond to nearby movements and to changes in water pressure sharks and rays are basal fish with numerous primitive anatomical features similar to those of ancient fish including skeletons composed of cartilage their bodies tend to be dorsoventrally flattened they usually have five pairs of gill slits and a large mouth set on the underside of the head the dermis is covered with separate dermal placoid scales they have a cloaca into which the urinary and genital passages open but not a swim bladder cartilaginous fish produce a small number of large yolky eggs some species are ovoviviparous and the young develop internally but others are oviparous and the larvae develop externally in egg cases the bony fish lineage shows more derived anatomical traits often with major evolutionary changes from the features of ancient fish they have a bony skeleton are generally laterally flattened have five pairs of gills protected by an operculum and a mouth at or near the tip of the snout the dermis is covered with overlapping scales bony fish have a swim bladder which helps them maintain a constant depth in the water column but not a cloaca they mostly spawn a large number of small eggs with little yolk which they broadcast into the water column amphibian anatomy skeleton of surinam horned frog ceratophrys cornuta plastic model of a frog amphibians are a class of animals comprising frogs salamanders and caecilians they are tetrapods but the caecilians and a few species of salamander have either no limbs or their limbs are much reduced in size their main bones are hollow and lightweight and are fully ossified and the vertebrae interlock with each other and have articular processes their ribs are usually short and may be fused to the vertebrae their skulls are mostly broad and short and are often incompletely ossified their skin contains little keratin and lacks scales but contains many mucous glands and in some species poison glands the hearts of amphibians have three chambers two atria and one ventricle they have a urinary bladder and nitrogenous waste products are excreted primarily as urea amphibians breathe by means of buccal pumping a pump action in which air is first drawn into the buccopharyngeal region through the nostrils these are then closed and the air is forced into the lungs by contraction of the throat they supplement this with gas exchange through the skin which needs to be kept moist in frogs the pelvic girdle is robust and the hind legs are much longer and stronger than the forelimbs the feet have four or five digits and the toes are often webbed for swimming or have suction pads for climbing frogs have large eyes and no tail salamanders resemble lizards in appearance their short legs project sideways the belly is close to or in contact with the ground and they have a long tail caecilians superficially resemble earthworms and are limbless they burrow by means of zones of muscle contractions which move along the body and they swim by undulating their body from side to side reptile anatomy skeleton of a diamondback rattlesnake reptiles are a class of animals comprising turtles tuataras lizards snakes and crocodiles they are tetrapods but the snakes and a few species of lizard either have no limbs or their limbs are much reduced in size their bones are better ossified and their skeletons stronger than those of amphibians the teeth are conical and mostly uniform in size the surface cells of the epidermis are modified into horny scales which create a waterproof layer reptiles are unable to use their skin for respiration as do amphibians and have a more efficient respiratory system drawing air into their lungs by expanding their chest walls the heart resembles that of the amphibian but there is a septum which more completely separates the oxygenated and deoxygenated bloodstreams the reproductive system has evolved for internal fertilization with a copulatory organ present in most species the eggs are surrounded by amniotic membranes which prevents them from drying out and are laid on land or develop internally in some species the bladder is small as nitrogenous waste is excreted as uric acid turtles are notable for their protective shells they have an inflexible trunk encased in a horny carapace above and a plastron below these are formed from bony plates embedded in the dermis which are overlain by horny ones and are partially fused with the ribs and spine the neck is long and flexible and the head and the legs can be drawn back inside the shell turtles are vegetarians and the typical reptile teeth have been replaced by sharp horny plates in aquatic species the front legs are modified into flippers tuataras superficially resemble lizards but the lineages diverged in the triassic period there is one living species sphenodon punctatus the skull has two openings fenestrae on either side and the jaw is rigidly attached to the skull there is one row of teeth in the lower jaw and this fits between the two rows in the upper jaw when the animal chews the teeth are merely projections of bony material from the jaw and eventually wear down the brain and heart are more primitive than those of other reptiles and the lungs have a single chamber and lack bronchi the tuatara has a welldeveloped parietal eye on its forehead lizards have skulls with only one fenestra on each side the lower bar of bone below the second fenestra having been lost this results in the jaws being less rigidly attached which allows the mouth to open wider lizards are mostly quadrupeds with the trunk held off the ground by short sidewaysfacing legs but a few species have no limbs and resemble snakes lizards have moveable eyelids eardrums are present and some species have a central parietal eye snakes are closely related to lizards having branched off from a common ancestral lineage during the cretaceous period and they share many of the same features the skeleton consists of a skull a hyoid bone spine and ribs though a few species retain a vestige of the pelvis and rear limbs in the form of pelvic spurs the bar under the second fenestra has also been lost and the jaws have extreme flexibility allowing the snake to swallow its prey whole snakes lack moveable eyelids the eyes being covered by transparent spectacle scales they do not have eardrums but can detect ground vibrations through the bones of their skull their forked tongues are used as organs of taste and smell and some species have sensory pits on their heads enabling them to locate warmblooded prey crocodilians are large lowslung aquatic reptiles with long snouts and large numbers of teeth the head and trunk are dorsoventrally flattened and the tail is laterally compressed it undulates from side to side to force the animal through the water when swimming the tough keratinized scales provide body armour and some are fused to the skull the nostrils eyes and ears are elevated above the top of the flat head enabling them to remain above the surface of the water when the animal is floating valves seal the nostrils and ears when it is submerged unlike other reptiles crocodilians have hearts with four chambers allowing complete separation of oxygenated and deoxygenated blood bird anatomy part of a wing albrecht dürer c 15001512 birds are tetrapods but though their hind limbs are used for walking or hopping their front limbs are wings covered with feathers and adapted for flight birds are endothermic have a high metabolic rate a light skeletal system and powerful muscles the long bones are thin hollow and very light air sac extensions from the lungs occupy the centre of some bones the sternum is wide and usually has a keel and the caudal vertebrae are fused there are no teeth and the narrow jaws are adapted into a horncovered beak the eyes are relatively large particularly in nocturnal species such as owls they face forwards in predators and sideways in ducks the feathers are outgrowths of the epidermis and are found in localized bands from where they fan out over the skin large flight feathers are found on the wings and tail contour feathers cover the birds surface and fine down occurs on young birds and under the contour feathers of water birds the only cutaneous gland is the single uropygial gland near the base of the tail this produces an oily secretion that waterproofs the feathers when the bird preens there are scales on the legs feet and claws on the tips of the toes mammal anatomy mammals are a diverse class of animals mostly terrestrial but some are aquatic and others have evolved flapping or gliding flight they mostly have four limbs but some aquatic mammals have no limbs or limbs modified into fins and the forelimbs of bats are modified into wings the legs of most mammals are situated below the trunk which is held well clear of the ground the bones of mammals are well ossified and their teeth which are usually differentiated are coated in a layer of prismatic enamel the teeth are shed once milk teeth during the animals lifetime or not at all as is the case in cetaceans mammals have three bones in the middle ear and a cochlea in the inner ear they are clothed in hair and their skin contains glands which secrete sweat some of these glands are specialized as mammary glands producing milk to feed the young mammals breathe with lungs and have a muscular diaphragm separating the thorax from the abdomen which helps them draw air into the lungs the mammalian heart has four chambers and oxygenated and deoxygenated blood are kept entirely separate nitrogenous waste is excreted primarily as urea mammals are amniotes and most are viviparous giving birth to live young the exception to this are the egglaying monotremes the platypus and the echidnas of australia most other mammals have a placenta through which the developing foetus obtains nourishment but in marsupials the foetal stage is very short and the immature young is born and finds its way to its mothers pouch where it latches on to a nipple and completes its development human anatomy mri scan in the human the development of skilled hand movements and increased brain size is likely to have evolved simultaneously humans have the overall body plan of a mammal humans have a head neck trunk which includes the thorax and abdomen two arms and hands and two legs and feet generally students of certain biological sciences paramedics prosthetists and orthotists physiotherapists occupational therapists nurses and medical students learn gross anatomy and microscopic anatomy from anatomical models skeletons textbooks diagrams photographs lectures and tutorials and in addition medical students generally also learn gross anatomy through practical experience of dissection and inspection of cadavers the study of microscopic anatomy or histology can be aided by practical experience examining histological preparations or slides under a microscope human anatomy physiology and biochemistry are complementary basic medical sciences which are generally taught to medical students in their first year at medical school human anatomy can be taught regionally or systemically that is respectively studying anatomy by bodily regions such as the head and chest or studying by specific systems such as the nervous or respiratory systems the major anatomy textbook grays anatomy has been reorganized from a systems format to a regional format in line with modern teaching methods a thorough working knowledge of anatomy is required by physicians especially surgeons and doctors working in some diagnostic specialties such as histopathology and radiology academic anatomists are usually employed by universities medical schools or teaching hospitals they are often involved in teaching anatomy and research into certain systems organs tissues or cells
63,ancient image of early rendition of anatomy findings in 1600 bce the edwin smith papyrus an ancient egyptian medical text described the heart its vessels liver spleen kidneys hypothalamus uterus and bladder and showed the blood vessels diverging from the heart the ebers papyrus c 1550 bce features a treatise on the heart with vessels carrying all the bodys fluids to or from every member of the body ancient greek anatomy and physiology underwent great changes and advances throughout the early medieval world over time this medical practice expanded by a continually developing understanding of the functions of organs and structures in the body phenomenal anatomical observations of the human body were made which have contributed towards the understanding of the brain eye liver reproductive organs and the nervous system the hellenistic egyptian city of alexandria was the steppingstone for greek anatomy and physiology alexandria not only housed the biggest library for medical records and books of the liberal arts in the world during the time of the greeks but was also home to many medical practitioners and philosophers great patronage of the arts and sciences from the ptolemy rulers helped raise alexandria up further rivalling the cultural and scientific achievements of other greek states some of the most striking advances in early anatomy and physiology took place in hellenistic alexandria two of the most famous anatomists and physiologists of the third century were herophilus and erasistratus these two physicians helped pioneer human dissection for medical research they also conducted vivisections on the cadavers of condemned criminals which was considered taboo until the renaissance herophilus was recognized as the first person to perform systematic dissections herophilus became known for his anatomical works making impressing contributions to many branches of anatomy and many other aspects of medicine some of the works included classifying the system of the pulse the discovery that human arteries had thicker walls then veins and that the atria were parts of the heart herophiluss knowledge of the human body has provided vital input towards understanding the brain eye liver reproductive organs and nervous system and characterizing the course of disease erasistratus accurately described the structure of the brain including the cavities and membranes and made a distinction between its cerebrum and cerebellum during his study in alexandria erasistratus was particularly concerned with studies of the circulatory and nervous systems he was able to distinguish the sensory and the motor nerves in the human body and believed that air entered the lungs and heart which was then carried throughout the body his distinction between the arteries and veins the arteries carrying the air through the body while the veins carried the blood from the heart was a great anatomical discovery erasistratus was also responsible for naming and describing the function of the epiglottis and the valves of the heart including the tricuspid during the third century greek physicians were able to differentiate nerves from blood vessels and tendons and to realize that the nerves convey neural impulses it was herophilus who made the point that damage to motor nerves induced paralysis herophilus named the meninges and ventricles in the brain appreciated the division between cerebellum and cerebrum and recognized that the brain was the seat of intellect and not a cooling chamber as propounded by aristotle herophilus is also credited with describing the optic oculomotor motor division of the trigeminal facial vestibulocochlear and hypoglossal nerves 13th century anatomical illustration great feats were made during the third century in both the digestive and reproductive systems herophilus was able to discover and describe not only the salivary glands but the small intestine and liver he showed that the uterus is a hollow organ and described the ovaries and uterine tubes he recognized that spermatozoa were produced by the testes and was the first to identify the prostate gland the anatomy of the muscles and skeleton is described in the hippocratic corpus an ancient greek medical work written by unknown authors aristotle described vertebrate anatomy based on animal dissection praxagoras identified the difference between arteries and veins also in the 4th century bce herophilos and erasistratus produced more accurate anatomical descriptions based on vivisection of criminals in alexandria during the ptolemaic dynasty in the 2nd century galen of pergamum an anatomist clinician writer and philosopher wrote the final and highly influential anatomy treatise of ancient times he compiled existing knowledge and studied anatomy through dissection of animals he was one of the first experimental physiologists through his vivisection experiments on animals galens drawings based mostly on dog anatomy became effectively the only anatomical textbook for the next thousand years his work was known to renaissance doctors only through islamic golden age medicine until it was translated from the greek some time in the 15th century medieval to early modern mondino de luzzi anathomia 1541 anatomical study of the arm by leonardo da vinci about 1510 anatomical chart in vesaliuss epitome 1543 michiel jansz van mierevelt anatomy lesson of dr willem van der meer 1617 anatomy developed little from classical times until the sixteenth century as the historian marie boas writes progress in anatomy before the sixteenth century is as mysteriously slow as its development after 1500 is startlingly rapid between 1275 and 1326 the anatomists mondino de luzzi alessandro achillini and antonio benivieni at bologna carried out the first systematic human dissections since ancient times mondinos anatomy of 1316 was the first textbook in the medieval rediscovery of human anatomy it describes the body in the order followed in mondinos dissections starting with the abdomen then the thorax then the head and limbs it was the standard anatomy textbook for the next century leonardo da vinci 14521519 was trained in anatomy by andrea del verrocchio he made use of his anatomical knowledge in his artwork making many sketches of skeletal structures muscles and organs of humans and other vertebrates that he dissected andreas vesalius 15141564 latinized from andries van wezel professor of anatomy at the university of padua is considered the founder of modern human anatomy originally from brabant vesalius published the influential book de humani corporis fabrica the structure of the human body a large format book in seven volumes in 1543 the accurate and intricately detailed illustrations often in allegorical poses against italianate landscapes are thought to have been made by the artist jan van calcar a pupil of titian in england anatomy was the subject of the first public lectures given in any science these were given by the company of barbers and surgeons in the 16th century joined in 1583 by the lumleian lectures in surgery at the royal college of physicians late modern in the united states medical schools began to be set up towards the end of the 18th century classes in anatomy needed a continual stream of cadavers for dissection and these were difficult to obtain philadelphia baltimore and new york were all renowned for body snatching activity as criminals raided graveyards at night removing newly buried corpses from their coffins a similar problem existed in britain where demand for bodies became so great that graveraiding and even anatomy murder were practised to obtain cadavers some graveyards were in consequence protected with watchtowers the practice was halted in britain by the anatomy act of 1832 while in the united states similar legislation was enacted after the physician william s forbes of jefferson medical college was found guilty in 1882 of complicity with resurrectionists in the despoliation of graves in lebanon cemetery the teaching of anatomy in britain was transformed by sir john struthers regius professor of anatomy at the university of aberdeen from 1863 to 1889 he was responsible for setting up the system of three years of preclinical academic teaching in the sciences underlying medicine including especially anatomy this system lasted until the reform of medical training in 1993 and 2003 as well as teaching he collected many vertebrate skeletons for his museum of comparative anatomy published over 70 research papers and became famous for his public dissection of the tay whale from 1822 the royal college of surgeons regulated the teaching of anatomy in medical schools medical museums provided examples in comparative anatomy and were often used in teaching ignaz semmelweis investigated puerperal fever and he discovered how it was caused he noticed that the frequently fatal fever occurred more often in mothers examined by medical students than by midwives the students went from the dissecting room to the hospital ward and examined women in childbirth semmelweis showed that when the trainees washed their hands in chlorinated lime before each clinical examination the incidence of puerperal fever among the mothers could be reduced dramatically an electron microscope from 1973 before the era of modern medical procedures the main means for studying the internal structure of the body were palpation and dissection it was the advent of microscopy that opened up an understanding of the building blocks that constituted living tissues technical advances in the development of achromatic lenses increased the resolving power of the microscope and around 1839 matthias jakob schleiden and theodor schwann identified that cells were the fundamental unit of organization of all living things study of small structures involved passing light through them and the microtome was invented to provide sufficiently thin slices of tissue to examine staining techniques using artificial dyes were established to help distinguish between different types of tissue the fields of cytology and histology developed from here in the late 19th century the invention of the electron microscope brought a great advance in resolution power and allowed research into the ultrastructure of cells and the organelles and other structures within them about the same time in the 1950s the use of xray diffraction for studying the crystal structures of proteins nucleic acids and other biological molecules gave rise to a new field of molecular anatomy short wavelength electromagnetic radiation such as xrays can be passed through the body and used in medical radiography to view interior structures that have different degrees of opaqueness nowadays modern techniques such as magnetic resonance imaging computed tomography fluoroscopy and ultrasound imaging have enabled researchers and practitioners to examine organs living or dead in unprecedented detail they are used for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes and provide information on the internal structures and organs of the body to a degree far beyond the imagination of earlier generations

65,tarkovsky became a film director during the mid and late 1950s a period referred to as the khrushchev thaw during which soviet society opened to foreign films literature and music among other things this allowed tarkovsky to see films of european american and japanese directors an experience which influenced his own film making his teacher and mentor at the film school mikhail romm allowed his students considerable freedom and emphasized the independence of the film director tarkovsky was according to fellow student shavkat abdusalmov fascinated by japanese films he was amazed by how every character on the screen is exceptional and how everyday events such as a samurai cutting bread with his sword are elevated to something special and put into the limelight tarkovsky has also expressed interest in the art of haiku and its ability to create images in such a way that they mean nothing beyond themselves tarkovsky perceived that the art of cinema has only been truly mastered by very few filmmakers stating in a 1970 interview with naum abramov that they can be counted on the fingers of one hand in 1972 tarkovsky told film historian leonid kozlov his ten favorite films the list includes diary of a country priest and mouchette by robert bresson winter light wild strawberries and persona by ingmar bergman nazarín by luis buñuel city lights by charlie chaplin ugetsu by kenji mizoguchi seven samurai by akira kurosawa and woman in the dunes by hiroshi teshigahara among his favorite directors were buñuel mizoguchi bergman bresson kurosawa michelangelo antonioni jean vigo and carl theodor dreyer with the exception of city lights the list does not contain any films of the early silent era the reason is that tarkovsky saw film as an art as only a relatively recent phenomenon with the early filmmaking forming only a prelude the list has also no films or directors from tarkovskys native russia although he rated soviet directors such as boris barnet sergei parajanov and alexander dovzhenko highly although strongly opposed to commercial cinema in a famous exception tarkovsky praised the blockbuster film the terminator saying its vision of the future and the relation between man and its destiny is pushing the frontier of cinema as an art he was critical of the brutality and low acting skills but nevertheless impressed by this film

some of his fathers poems tarkovsky had worked on the screenplay for this film since 1967 under the consecutive titles confession white day and a white white day from the beginning the film was not well received by soviet authorities due to its content and its perceived elitist nature russian authorities placed the film in the third category a severely limited distribution and only allowed it to be shown in thirdclass cinemas and workers clubs few prints were made and the filmmakers received no returns third category films also placed the filmmakers in danger of being accused of wasting public funds which could have serious effects on their future productivity these difficulties are presumed to have made tarkovsky play with the idea of going abroad and producing a film outside the

the kgb evidence for this hypothesis includes testimonies by former kgb agents who claim that viktor chebrikov gave the order to eradicate tarkovsky to curtail what the soviet government and the kgb saw as antisoviet propaganda by tarkovsky other evidence includes several memoranda that surfaced after the 1991 coup and the claim by one of tarkovskys doctors that his cancer could not have developed from a natural cause as with tarkovsky his wife larisa tarkovskaya and actor anatoli solonitsyn all died from the very same type of lung cancer vladimir sharun sound designer in stalker is

university and served as a judge in kozelsk according to the family legend tarkovskys ancestors on his fathers side were princes from the shamkhalate of tarki dagestan although his sister marina tarkovskaya who did a detailed research on their genealogy called it a myth even a prank of sorts stressing that none of the documents confirms this version tarkovsky spent his childhood in yuryevets he was described by childhood friends as active and popular having many friends and being typically in the center of action his father left the family in 1937 subsequently volunteering for the army in 1941 tarkovsky stayed with his mother moving with her and his sister marina to moscow where she worked as a proofreader at a printing press in 1939 tarkovsky enrolled at the moscow school 554 during

film mirror in his school years tarkovsky was a troublemaker and a poor student he still managed to graduate and from 1951 to 1952 studied arabic at the oriental institute in moscow a branch of the academy of sciences of the ussr although he already spoke some arabic and was a successful student in his first semesters he did not finish his studies and dropped out to work as a prospector for the academy of science institute for nonferrous metals and gold he participated in a yearlong research expedition to the river kureikye near turukhansk in the krasnoyarsk province during this time in the taiga tarkovsky decided to study film film school student upon returning from the research expedition in 1954 tarkovsky applied at the state institute of cinematography vgik and was admitted to the filmdirecting program he was in the same class as irma raush whom he married in april 1957 the early khrushchev era offered good opportunities for young film directors before 1953 annual film production was low and most films were directed by veteran directors after 1953 more films were produced many of them by young directors the khrushchev thaw relaxed soviet social restrictions a bit and permitted a limited influx of european and north american literature films and music this allowed tarkovsky to see films of the italian neorealists french new wave and of directors such as kurosawa buñuel bergman bresson andrzej wajda whose film ashes and diamonds influenced tarkovsky and mizoguchi tarkovsky absorbed the idea of the auteur as a necessary condition for creativity tarkovskys teacher and mentor was mikhail romm who taught many film students who would later become influential film directors in 1956 tarkovsky directed his first student short film the killers from a short story of ernest hemingway the short film there will be no leave today and the screenplay concentrate followed in 1958 and 1959 an important influence on tarkovsky was the film director grigori chukhrai who was teaching at the vgik impressed by the talent of his student chukhrai offered tarkovsky a position as assistant director for his film clear skies tarkovsky initially showed interest but then decided to concentrate on his studies and his own projects during his third year at the vgik tarkovsky met andrei konchalovsky they found much in common as they liked the same film directors and shared ideas on cinema and films in 1959 they wrote the script antarctica distant country which was later published in the moskovskij komsomolets tarkovsky submitted the script to lenfilm but it

65,in a 1962 interview tarkovsky argued all art of course is intellectual but for me all the arts and cinema even more so must above all be emotional and act upon the heart his films are characterized by metaphysical themes extremely long takes and images often considered by critics to be of exceptional beauty recurring motifs are dreams memory childhood running water accompanied by fire rain indoors reflections levitation and characters reappearing in the foreground of long panning movements of the camera he once said juxtaposing a person with an environment that is boundless collating him with a countless number of people passing by close to him and far away relating a person to the whole world that is the meaning of cinema tarkovsky incorporated levitation scenes into several of his films most notably solaris to him these scenes possess great power and are used for their photogenic value and magical inexplicability water clouds and reflections were used by him for their surreal beauty and photogenic value as well as their symbolism such as waves or the forms of brooks or running water bells and candles are also frequent symbols these are symbols of film sight and sound and tarkovskys film frequently has themes of selfreflection tarkovsky developed a theory of cinema that he called sculpting in time by this he meant that the unique characteristic of cinema as a medium was to take our experience of time and alter it unedited movie footage transcribes time in real time by using long takes and few cuts in his films he aimed to give the viewers a sense of time passing time lost and the relationship of one moment in time to another up to and including his film mirror tarkovsky focused his cinematic works on exploring this theory after mirror he announced that he would focus his work on exploring the dramatic unities proposed by aristotle a concentrated action happening in one place within the span of a single day several of tarkovskys films have color or black and white sequences this first occurs in the otherwise monochrome andrei rublev which features a color epilogue of rublevs authentic religious icon paintings all of his films afterwards contain monochrome and in stalkers case sepia sequences while otherwise being in color in 1966 in an interview conducted shortly after finishing andrei rublev tarkovsky dismissed color film as a commercial gimmick and cast doubt on the idea that contemporary films meaningfully use color he claimed that in everyday life one does not consciously notice colors most of the time and that color should therefore be used in film mainly to emphasize certain moments but not all the time as this distracts the viewer to him films in color were like moving paintings or photographs which are too beautiful to be a realistic depiction of life vadim yusov tarkovsky worked in close collaboration with cinematographer vadim yusov from 1958 to 1972 and much of the visual style of tarkovskys films can be attributed to this collaboration tarkovsky would spend two days preparing for yusov to film a single long take and due to the preparation usually only a single take was needed sven nykvist in his last film the sacrifice tarkovsky worked with cinematographer sven nykvist who had worked closely with director ingmar bergman on many of ingmar bergmans films multiple people who worked with bergman worked on the production notably lead actor erland josephson who had acted for tarkovsky in nostalghia nykvist complained that tarkovsky would frequently look through the camera and even direct actors through it

66,mathematical notation widely used in physics and other sciences avoids many ambiguities compared to expression in natural language however for various reasons several lexical syntactic and semantic ambiguities remain names of functions the ambiguity in the style of writing a function should not be confused with a multivalued function which can and should be defined in a deterministic and unambiguous way several special functions still do not have established notations usually the conversion to another notation requires to scale the argument or the resulting value sometimes the same name of the function is used causing confusions examples of such underestablished functions sinc function elliptic integral of the third kind translating elliptic integral form maple to mathematica one should replace the second argument to its square see talkelliptic integrallist of notations dealing with complex values this may cause problems exponential integral hermite polynomial expressions ambiguous expressions often appear in physical and mathematical texts it is common practice to omit multiplication signs in mathematical expressions also it is common to give the same name to a variable and a function for example then if one sees there is no way to distinguish whether it means multiplied by or function evaluated at argument equal to in each case of use of such notations the reader is supposed to be able to perform the deduction and reveal the true meaning creators of algorithmic languages try to avoid ambiguities many algorithmic languages c and fortran require the character as symbol of multiplication the wolfram language used in mathematica allows the user to omit the multiplication symbol but requires square brackets to indicate the argument of a function square brackets are not allowed for grouping of expressions fortran in addition does not allow use of the same name identifier for different objects for example function and variable in particular the expression ffx is qualified as an error the order of operations may depend on the context in most programming languages the operations of division and multiplication have equal priority and are executed from left to right until the last century many editorials assumed that multiplication is performed first for example is interpreted as in this case the insertion of parentheses is required when translating the formulas to an algorithmic language in addition it is common to write an argument of a function without parenthesis which also may lead to ambiguity sometimes one uses italics letters to denote elementary functions in the scientific journal style the expression means product of variables and although in a slideshow it may mean a comma in subscripts and superscripts sometimes is omitted it is also ambiguous notation if it is written the reader should guess from the context does it mean a singleindex object evaluated while the subscript is equal to product of variables and or it is indication to a trivalent tensor the writing of instead of may mean that the writer either is stretched in space for example to reduce the publication fees or aims to increase number of publications without considering readers the same may apply to any other use of ambiguous notations subscripts are also used to denote the argument to a function as in examples of potentially confusing ambiguous mathematical expressions which could be understood to mean either or in addition may mean as means see tetration which by convention means though it might be thought to mean since means which arguably should mean but would commonly be understood to mean notations in quantum optics and quantum mechanics it is common to define the coherent states in quantum optics with and states with fixed number of photons with then there is an unwritten rule the state is coherent if there are more greek characters than latin characters in the argument and photon state if the latin characters dominate the ambiguity becomes even worse if is used for the states with certain value of the coordinate and means the state with certain value of the momentum which may be used in books on quantum mechanics such ambiguities easily lead to confusions especially if some normalized adimensional dimensionless variables are used expression may mean a state with single photon or the coherent state with mean amplitude equal to 1 or state with momentum equal to unity and so on the reader is supposed to guess from the context ambiguous terms in physics and mathematics some physical quantities do not yet have established notations their value and sometimes even dimension as in the case of the einstein coefficients depends on the system of notations many terms are ambiguous each use of an ambiguous term should be preceded by the definition suitable for a specific case just like ludwig wittgenstein states in tractatus logicophilosophicus only in the context of a proposition has a name meaning a highly confusing term is gain for example the sentence the gain of a system should be doubled without context means close to nothing it may mean that the ratio of the output voltage of an electric circuit to the input voltage should be doubled it may mean that the ratio of the output power of an electric or optical circuit to the input power should be doubled it may mean that the gain of the laser medium should be doubled for example doubling the population of the upper laser level in a quasitwo level system assuming negligible absorption of the groundstate the term intensity is ambiguous when applied to light the term can refer to any of irradiance luminous intensity radiant intensity or radiance depending on the background of the person using the term also confusions may be related with the use of atomic percent as measure of concentration of a dopant or resolution of an imaging system as measure of the size of the smallest detail which still can be resolved at the background of statistical noise see also accuracy and precision and its talk the berry paradox arises as a result of systematic ambiguity in the meaning of terms such as definable or nameable terms of this kind give rise to vicious circle fallacies other terms with this type of ambiguity are satisfiable true false function property class relation cardinal and ordinal
66,some languages have been created with the intention of avoiding ambiguity especially lexical ambiguity lojban and loglan are two related languages which have been created for this focusing chiefly on syntactic ambiguity as well the languages can be both spoken and written these languages are intended to provide a greater technical precision over big natural languages although historically such attempts at language improvement have been criticized languages composed from many diverse sources contain much ambiguity and inconsistency the many exceptions to syntax and semantic rules are timeconsuming and difficult to learn
66,structural analysis of an ambiguous spanish sentence pepe vio a pablo enfurecidointerpretation 1 when pepe was angry then he saw pablointerpretation 2 pepe saw that pablo was angryhere the syntactic tree in figure represents interpretation 2 the lexical ambiguity of a word or phrase pertains to its having more than one meaning in the language to which the word belongs meaning here refers to whatever should be captured by a good dictionary for instance the word bank has several distinct lexical definitions including financial institution and edge of a river or consider apothecary one could say i bought herbs from the apothecary this could mean one actually spoke to the apothecary pharmacist or went to the apothecary pharmacy the context in which an ambiguous word is used often makes it evident which of the meanings is intended if for instance someone says i buried 100 in the bank most people would not think someone used a shovel to dig in the mud however some linguistic contexts do not provide sufficient information to disambiguate a used word lexical ambiguity can be addressed by algorithmic methods that automatically associate the appropriate meaning with a word in context a task referred to as word sense disambiguation the use of multidefined words requires the author or speaker to clarify their context and sometimes elaborate on their specific intended meaning in which case a less ambiguous term should have been used the goal of clear concise communication is that the receivers have no misunderstanding about what was meant to be conveyed an exception to this could include a politician whose weasel words and obfuscation are necessary to gain support from multiple constituents with mutually exclusive conflicting desires from their candidate of choice ambiguity is a powerful tool of political science more problematic are words whose senses express closely related concepts good for example can mean useful or functional thats a good hammer exemplary shes a good student pleasing this is good soup moral a good person versus the lesson to be learned from a story righteous etc i have a good daughter is not clear about which sense is intended the various ways to apply prefixes and suffixes can also create ambiguity unlockable can mean capable of being unlocked or impossible to lock syntactic ambiguity arises when a sentence can have two or more different meanings because of the structure of the sentenceits syntax this is often due to a modifying expression such as a prepositional phrase the application of which is unclear he ate the cookies on the couch for example could mean that he ate those cookies that were on the couch as opposed to those that were on the table or it could mean that he was sitting on the couch when he ate the cookies to get in you will need an entrance fee of 10 or your voucher and your drivers license this could mean that you need either ten dollars or both your voucher and your license or it could mean that you need your license and you need either ten dollars or a voucher only rewriting the sentence or placing appropriate punctuation can resolve a syntactic ambiguity for the notion of and theoretic results about syntactic ambiguity in artificial formal languages such as computer programming languages see ambiguous grammar spoken language can contain many more types of ambiguities which are called phonological ambiguities where there is more than one way to compose a set of sounds into words for example ice cream and i scream such ambiguity is generally resolved according to the context a mishearing of such based on incorrectly resolved ambiguity is called a mondegreen semantic ambiguity happens when a sentence contains an ambiguous word or phrasea word or phrase that has more than one meaning in we saw her duck example due to richard nordquist the word duck can refer either to the persons bird the noun duck modified by the possessive pronoun her or to a motion she made the verb duck the subject of which is the objective pronoun her object of the verb saw for example you could do with a new automobile how about a test drive the clause you could do with presents a statement with such wide possible interpretation as to be essentially meaningless lexical ambiguity is contrasted with semantic ambiguity the former represents a choice between a finite number of known and meaningful contextdependent interpretations the latter represents a choice between any number of possible interpretations none of which may have a standard agreedupon meaning this form of ambiguity is closely related to vagueness linguistic ambiguity can be a problem in law because the interpretation of written documents and oral agreements is often of paramount importance philosophers and other users of logic spend a lot of time and effort searching for and removing or intentionally adding ambiguity in arguments because it can lead to incorrect conclusions and can be used to deliberately conceal bad arguments for example a politician might say i oppose taxes which hinder economic growth an example of a glittering generality some will think he opposes taxes in general because they hinder economic growth others may think he opposes only those taxes that he believes will hinder economic growth in writing the sentence can be rewritten to reduce possible misinterpretation either by adding a comma after taxes to convey the first sense or by changing which to that to convey the second sense or by rewriting it in other ways the devious politician hopes that each constituent will interpret the statement in the most desirable way and think the politician supports everyones opinion however the opposite can also be true an opponent can turn a positive statement into a bad one if the speaker uses ambiguity intentionally or not the logical fallacies of amphiboly and equivocation rely heavily on the use of ambiguous words and phrases in continental philosophy particularly phenomenology and existentialism there is much greater tolerance of ambiguity as it is generally seen as an integral part of the human condition martin heidegger argued that the relation between the subject and object is ambiguous as is the relation of mind and body and part and whole3 in heideggers phenomenology dasein is always in a meaningful world but there is always an underlying background for every instance of signification thus although some things may be certain they have little to do with daseins sense of care and existential anxiety eg in the face of death in calling his work being and nothingness an essay in phenomenological ontology jeanpaul sartre follows heidegger in defining the human essence as ambiguous or relating fundamentally to such ambiguity simone de beauvoir tries to base an ethics on heideggers and sartres writings the ethics of ambiguity where she highlights the need to grapple with ambiguity as long as philosophers and they men have thought most of them have tried to mask itand the ethics which they have proposed to their disciples have always pursued the same goal it has been a matter of eliminating the ambiguity by making oneself pure inwardness or pure externality by escaping from the sensible world or being engulfed by it by yielding to eternity or enclosing oneself in the pure moment ethics cannot be based on the authoritative certainty given by mathematics and logic or prescribed directly from the empirical findings of science she states since we do not succeed in fleeing it let us therefore try to look the truth in the face let us try to assume our fundamental ambiguity it is in the knowledge of the genuine conditions of our life that we must draw our strength to live and our reason for acting other continental philosophers suggest that concepts such as life nature and sex are ambiguous corey anton has argued that we cannot be certain what is separate from or unified with something else language he asserts divides what is not in fact separate following ernest becker he argues that the desire to authoritatively disambiguate the world and existence have led to numerous ideologies and historical events such as genocide on this basis he argues that ethics must focus on dialectically integrating opposites and balancing tension rather than seeking a priori validation or certainty like the existentialists and phenomenologists he sees the ambiguity of life as the basis of creativity in literature and rhetoric ambiguity can be a useful tool groucho marxs classic joke depends on a grammatical ambiguity for its humor for example last night i shot an elephant in my pajamas how he got in my pajamas ill never know songs and poetry often rely on ambiguous words for artistic effect as in the song title dont it make my brown eyes blue where blue can refer to the color or to sadness in narrative ambiguity can be introduced in several ways motive plot character f scott fitzgerald uses the latter type of ambiguity with notable effect in his novel the great gatsby christianity and judaism employ the concept of paradox synonymously with ambiguity many christians and jews endorse rudolf ottos description of the sacred as mysterium tremendum et fascinans the aweinspiring mystery which fascinates humansdubious discuss the orthodox catholic writer g k chesterton regularly employed paradox to tease out the meanings in common concepts which he found ambiguous or to reveal meaning often overlooked or forgotten in common phrases the title of one of his most famous books orthodoxy itself employing such a paradox metonymy involves the use of the name of a subcomponent part as an abbreviation or jargon for the name of the whole object for example wheels to refer to a car or flowers to refer to beautiful offspring an entire plant or a collection of blooming plants in modern vocabulary critical semiotics9 metonymy encompasses any potentially ambiguous word substitution that is based on contextual contiguity located close together or a function or process that an object performs such as sweet ride to refer to a nice car metonym miscommunication is

68,aardvark resting entrance to a burrow emerging from a burrow aardvarks live for up to 23 years in captivity its keen hearing warns it of predators lions leopards cheetahs hunting dogs hyenas and pythons some humans also hunt aardvarks for meat aardvarks can dig fast or run in zigzag fashion to elude enemies but if all else fails they will strike with their claws tail and shoulders sometimes flipping onto their backs lying motionless except to lash out with all four feet they are capable of causing substantial damage to unprotected areas of an attacker they will also dig to escape as they can when pressed dig extremely quickly their thick skin also protects them to some extent feeding the aardvark is nocturnal and is a solitary creature that feeds almost exclusively on ants and termites formivore the only fruit eaten by aardvarks is the aardvark cucumber in fact the cucumber and the aardvark have a symbiotic relationship as they eat the subterranean fruit then defecate the seeds near their burrows which then grow rapidly due to the loose soil and fertile nature of the area the time spent in the intestine of the aardvark helps the fertility of the seed and the fruit provides needed moisture for the aardvark they avoid eating the african driver ant and red ants due to their stringent diet requirements they require a large range to survive an aardvark emerges from its burrow in the late afternoon or shortly after sunset and forages over a considerable home range encompassing while foraging for food the aardvark will keep its nose to the ground and its ears pointed forward which indicates that both smell and hearing are involved in the search for food they zigzag as they forage and will usually not repeat a route for 58 days as they appear to allow time for the termite nests to recover before feeding on it again during a foraging period they will stop and dig a v shaped trench with their forefeet and then sniff it profusely as a means to explore their location when a concentration of ants or termites is detected the aardvark digs into it with its powerful front legs keeping its long ears upright to listen for predators and takes up an astonishing number of insects with its long sticky tongueas many as 50000 in one night have been recorded its claws enable it to dig through the extremely hard crust of a termite or ant mound quickly it avoids inhaling the dust by sealing the nostrils when successful the aardvarks long up to tongue licks up the insects the termites biting or the ants stinging attacks are rendered futile by the tough skin after an aardvark visit at a termite mound other animals will visit to pick up all the leftovers termite mounds alone dont provide enough food for the aardvark so they look for termites that are on the move when these insects move they can form columns long and these tend to provide easy pickings with little effort exerted by the aardvark these columns are more common in areas of livestock or other hoofed animals the trampled grass and dung attract termites from odontotermes microtermes and pseudacanthotermes genera on a nightly basis they tend to be more active during the first portion of the night time 20000000 however they dont seem to prefer bright or dark nights over the other during adverse weather or if disturbed they will retreat to their burrow systems they cover between per night however some studies have shown that they may traverse as far as in a night vocalization the aardvark is a rather quiet animal however it does make soft grunting sounds as it forages and loud grunts as it makes for its tunnel entrance it makes a bleating sound if frightened when it is threatened it will make for one of its burrows if one is not close it will dig a new one rapidly this new one will be short and require the aardvark to back out when the coast is clear movement the aardvark is known to be a good swimmer and has been witnessed successfully swimming in strong currents it can dig a yard of tunnel in about five minutes but otherwise moves fairly slowly when leaving the burrow at night they pause at the entrance for about ten minutes sniffing and listening after this period of watchfulness it will bound out and within seconds it will be away it will then pause prick its ears twisting its head to listen then jump and move off to start foraging aside from digging out ants and termites the aardvark also excavates burrows in which to live of which they generally fall into three categories burrows made while foraging refuge and resting location and permanent homes temporary sites are scattered around the home range and are used as refuges while the main burrow is also used for breeding main burrows can be deep and extensive have several entrances and can be as long as these burrows can be large enough for a man to enter the aardvark changes the layout of its home burrow regularly and periodically moves on and makes a new one the old burrows are an important part of the african wildlife scene as they are vacated then they are inhabited by smaller animals like the african wild dog anteating chat nycteris thebaica and warthogs other animals that use them are hares mongooses hyenas owls pythons and lizards without these refuges many animals would die during wildfire season only mothers and young share burrows however the aardvark is known to live in small family groups or as a solitary creature if attacked in the tunnel it will escape by digging out of the tunnel thereby placing the fresh fill between it and its predator or if it decides to fight it will roll onto its back and attack with its claws the aardvark has been known to sleep in a recently excavated ant nest which also serves as protection from its predators reproduction aardvark mother and young aardvarks pair only during the breeding season after a gestation period of seven months one cub weighing around is born during mayjuly when born the young has flaccid ears and many wrinkles when nursing it will nurse off each teat in succession after two weeks the folds of skin disappear and after three the ears can be held upright after 56 weeks body hair starts growing it is able to leave the burrow to accompany its mother after only two weeks is eating termites at 9 weeks and is weaned between three months and 16 weeks at six months of age it is able to dig its own burrows but it will often remain with the mother until the next mating season and is sexually mature from approximately two years of age
68,naming the aardvark is sometimes colloquially called african ant bear anteater not to be confused with the south american anteater or the cape anteater after the cape of good hope the name aardvark comes from earlier afrikaans erdvark and means earth pig or ground pig aarde earthground vark pig because of its burrowing habits similar origin to the name groundhog the name orycteropus means burrowing foot and the name afer refers to africa the name of the aardvarkss order tubulidentata comes from the tubulestyle teeth taxonomy the aardvark is not closely related to the pig rather it is the sole extant representative of the obscure mammalian order tubulidentata in which it is usually considered to form one variable species of the genus orycteropus the sole surviving genus in the family orycteropodidae the aardvark is not closely related to the south american anteater despite sharing some characteristics and a superficial resemblance the similarities are based on convergent evolution the closest living relatives of the aardvark are the elephant shrews tenrecs and golden moles along with the sirenians hyraxes elephants and their extinct relatives these animals form the superorder afrotheria studies of the brain have shown the similarities with condylarthra and given the clades status as a wastebasket taxon it may mean some species traditionally classified as condylarths are actually stemaardvarks evolutionary history based on fossils bryan patterson has concluded that early relatives of the aardvark appeared in africa around the end of the paleocene the ptolemaiidans a mysterious clade of mammals with uncertain affinities may actually be stemaardvarks either as a sister clade to tubulidentata or as a grade leading to true tubulidentates the first unambiguous tubulidentate was probably myorycteropus africanus from kenyan miocene deposits the earliest example from the orycteropus genus was the orycteropus mauritanicus found in algeria in deposits from the middle miocene with an equally aged version found in kenya fossils from the aardvark have been dated to 5 million years and have been located throughout europe and the near east the mysterious pleistocene plesiorycteropus from madagascar was originally thought to be a tubulidentate that was descended from ancestors that entered the island during the eocene however a number of subtle anatomical differences coupled with recent molecular evidence now lead researchers to believe that plesiorycteropus is a relative of golden moles and tenrecs that achieved an aardvarklike appearance and ecological niche through convergent evolution subspecies the aardvark has seventeen poorly defined subspecies listed orycteropus afer afer o a adametzi grote 1921 o a aethiopicus sundevall 1843 o a angolensis zukowsky haltenorth 1957 o a erikssoni lönnberg 1906 o a faradjius hatt 1932 o a haussanus matschie 1900 o a kordofanicus rothschild 1927 o a lademanni grote 1911 o a leptodon hirst 1906 o a matschiei grote 1921 o a observandus grote 1921 o a ruvanensis grote 1921 o a senegalensis lesson 1840 o a somalicus lydekker 1908 o a wardi lydekker 1908 o a wertheri matschie 1898 the 1911 encyclopædia britannica also mentions o a capensis or cape antbear from south africa

68,aardvarks were thought to have declining numbers however this is possibly due to the fact that they are not readily seen there are no definitive counts because of their nocturnal and secretive habits however their numbers seem to be stable overall they are not considered common anywhere in africa but due to their large range they maintain sufficient numbers there may be a slight decrease in numbers in eastern northern and western africa southern african numbers are not decreasing it receives an official designation from the iucn as least concern however they are a species in a precarious situation as they are so dependent on such specific food therefore if a problem arises with the abundance of termites the species as a whole would be affected drastically aardvarks handle captivity well the first zoo to have one was london zoo in 1869 which had an animal from south africa

69,the aardwolf has not seen decreasing numbers and they are relatively widespread throughout eastern africa they are not common throughout their range as they maintain a density of no more than 1 per square kilometer if the food is good because of these factors the iucn has rated the aardwolf as least concern in some areas they are persecuted by man because of the mistaken belief that they prey on livestock however they are actually beneficial to the farmers because they eat termites that are detrimental in other areas the farmers have recognized this but they are still killed on occasion for their fur dogs and insecticides are also common killers of the aardwolf
69,san antonio zoo aardwolves are shy and nocturnal sleeping in underground burrows by day they will on occasion during the winter become diurnal feeders this happens during the coldest periods as they then stay in at night to conserve heat they have often been mistaken for solitary animals in fact they live as monogamous pairs with their young if their territory is infringed upon they will chase the intruder up to or to the border if the intruder is caught which rarely happens a fight will occur which is accompanied by soft clucking hoarse barking and a type of roar the majority of incursions occur during mating season when they can occur once or twice per week when food is scarce the stringent territorial system may be abandoned and as many as three pairs may occupy a single territory the territory is marked by both sexes as they both have developed anal glands from which they extrude a black substance that is smeared on rocks or grass stalks in long streaks aardwolves also have scent glands on the forefoot and penile pad they often mark near termite mounds within their territory every 20 minutes or so if they are patrolling their territorial boundaries the marking frequency increases drastically to once every at this rate an individual may mark 60 marks per hour and upwards of 200 per night an aardwolf pair may have up to 10 dens and numerous middens within their territory when they deposit feces at their middens they dig a small hole and then cover it with sand their dens are usually abandoned aardvark springhare or porcupine dens or on occasion they are crevices in rocks they will also dig their own dens or enlarge dens started by springhares they typically will only use one or two dens at a time rotating through all of their dens every six months during the summer they may rest outside their den during the night and sleep underground during the heat of the day aardwolves are not fast runners nor are they particularly adept at fighting off predators therefore when threatened the aardwolf may attempt to mislead its foe by doubling back on its tracks if confronted it may raise its mane in an attempt to appear more menacing it also emits a foulsmelling liquid from its anal glands feeding the aardwolf feeds primarily on termites and more specifically on trinervitermes this genus of termites has different species throughout the aardwolfs range in east africa they eat t bettonianus and in central africa they eat t rhodesiensis and finally in southern africa they eat t trinervoides their technique consists of licking them off the ground as opposed to the aardvark which digs into the mound they locate their food by sound and also from the scent secreted by the soldier termites an aardwolf may consume up to 250000 termites per night using its sticky long tongue they do not destroy the termite mound or consume the entire colony thus ensuring that the termites can rebuild and provide a continuous supply of food they often memorize the location of such nests and return to them every few months during certain seasonal events such as the onset of the rainy season and the cold of midwinter the primary termites become scarce so the need for other foods becomes pronounced during these times the southern aardwolf will seek out hodotermes mossambicus a type of harvester termite active in the afternoon which explains some of their diurnal behavior in the winter the eastern aardwolf during the rainy season subsists on termites from the genera odontotermes and macrotermes they are also known to feed on other insects larvae eggs and some sources say occasionally small mammals and birds but these constitute a very small percentage of their total diet unlike other hyenas aardwolves do not scavenge or kill larger animals contrary to popular myths aardwolves do not eat carrion and if they are seen eating while hunched over a dead carcass they are actually eating larvae and beetles also contrary to some sources they do not like meat unless it is finely ground or cooked for them the adult aardwolf was formerly assumed to forage in small groups but more recent research has shown that they are primarily solitary foragers necessary because of the scarcity of their insect prey their primary source trinervitermes forages in small but dense patches of while foraging the aardwolf can cover about per hour which translates to per summer night and per winter night breeding the breeding season varies depending on location but normally takes place during autumn or spring in south africa breeding occurs in early july during the breeding season unpaired male aardwolves search their own territory as well as others for a female to mate with dominant males also mate opportunistically with the females of less dominant neighboring aardwolves which can result in conflict between rival males dominant males even go a step further and as the breeding season approaches they make increasingly greater and greater incursions onto weaker males territories as the female comes into oestrus they add pasting to their tricks inside of the other territories sometimes doing so more in rivals territories than their own females will also when given the opportunity mate with the dominant male which increases the chances of the dominant male guarding his cubs with her copulation lasts between 1 and 45 hours gestation lasts between 89 and 92 days producing two to five cubs most often two or three during the rainy season novemberdecember when termites are more active they are born with their eyes open but initially are helpless and weigh around the first six to eight weeks are spent in the den with their parents the male may spend up to six hours a night watching over the cubs while the mother is out looking for food after three months they begin supervised foraging and by four months are normally independent though they often share a den with their mother until the next breeding season by the time the next set of cubs is born the older cubs have moved on aardwolves generally achieve sexual maturity at one and a half to two years of age

70,an adobe brick is a composite material made of earth mixed with water and an organic material such as straw or dung the soil composition typically contains sand silt and clay straw is useful in binding the brick together and allowing the brick to dry evenly thereby preventing cracking due to uneven shrinkage rates through the brick dung offers the same advantage the most desirable soil texture for producing the mud of adobe is 15 clay 1030 silt and 5575 fine sand another source quotes 1525 clay and the remainder sand and coarser particles up to cobbles with no deleterious effect modern adobe is stabilized with either emulsified asphalt or portland cement up to 10 by weight no more than half the clay content should be expansive clays with the remainder nonexpansive illite or kaolinite too much expansive clay results in uneven drying through the brick resulting in cracking while too much kaolinite will make a weak brick typically the soils of the southwest united states where such construction is in use are an adequate composition
70,poured and puddled adobe walls cliff dwellings of poured or puddled adobe cob at cuarenta casas in mexico poured and puddled adobe puddled clay piled earth today called cob is made by placing soft adobe in layers rather than making by individual dried bricks or using a form puddle is a general term for a clay or clay and sand based material worked into a dense plastic state these are the oldest methods of building with adobe in the americas until holes in the ground were used as forms and then later wooden forms used to make individual bricks were introduced by the spanish adobe bricks adobe bricks near a construction site in milyanfan kyrgyzstan bricks made from adobe are usually made by pressing the mud mixture into an open timber frame in north america the brick is typically about in size the mixture is molded into the frame which is then is removed after initial setting after drying for a few hours the bricks are turned on edge to finish drying slow drying in shade reduces cracking the same mixture without straw is used to make mortar and often plaster on interior and exterior walls some ancient cultures used limebased cement for the plaster to protect against rain damage depending on the form into which the mixture is pressed adobe can encompass nearly any shape or size provided drying is even and the mixture includes reinforcement for larger bricks reinforcement can include manure straw cement rebar or wooden posts experience has shown straw cement or manure added to a standard adobe mixture can all produce a stronger more crackresistant brick a test is done on the soil content first to do so a sample of the soil is mixed into a clear container with some water creating an almost completely saturated liquid the container is shaken vigorously for one minute it is then allowed to settle for a day until the soil has settled into layers heavier particles settle out first sand above silt above that and very fine clay and organic matter will stay in suspension for days after the water has cleared percentages of the various particles can be determined fifty to 60 percent sand and 35 to 40 percent clay will yield strong bricks the

construction codes call for the use of reinforcing steel in the footing and stem wall adobe bricks are laid by course adobe walls usually never rise above two stories as they are load bearing and adobe has low structural strength when creating window and door openings a lintel is placed on top of the opening to support the bricks above atop the last courses of brick bond beams made of heavy wood beams or modern reinforced concrete are laid to provide a horizontal bearing plate for the roof beams and to redistribute lateral earthquake loads to shear walls more able to carry the forces to protect the interior and exterior adobe walls finishes such as mud plaster whitewash or stucco can be applied these protect the adobe wall from water damage but need to be reapplied periodically alternatively the walls can be finished with other nontraditional plasters that provide longer protection bricks made with stabilized adobe generally do not need protection of plasters adobe roof the traditional adobe roof has been constructed using a mixture of soilclay water sand and organic materials the mixture was then formed and pressed into wood forms producing rows of dried earth bricks that would then be laid across a support structure of wood and plastered into place with more adobe depending on the materials available a roof may be assembled using wood or metal beams to create a framework to begin layering adobe bricks depending on the thickness of the adobe bricks the framework has been preformed using a steel framing and a layering of a metal fencing or wiring over the framework to allow an even load as masses of adobe are spread across the metal fencing like cob and allowed to air dry accordingly this method was demonstrated with an adobe blend heavily impregnated with cement to allow even drying and prevent cracking the more traditional flat adobe roofs are functional only in dry climates that are not exposed to snow loads the heaviest wooden beams called vigas lie atop the wall across the vigas lie smaller members called latillas and upon those brush is then laid finally the adobe layer is applied to construct a flat adobe roof beams of wood were laid to span the building the ends of which were attached to the tops of the walls once the vigas latillas and brush are laid adobe bricks are placed an adobe roof is often laid with bricks slightly larger in width to ensure a greater expanse is covered when placing the bricks onto the roof following each individual brick should be a layer of adobe mortar recommended to be at least thick to make certain there is ample strength between the bricks edges and also to provide a relative moisture barrier during rain depending on the materials adobe roofs can be inherently fireproof the construction of a chimney can greatly influence the construction of the roof supports creating an extra need for care in choosing the materials the builders can make an adobe chimney by stacking simple adobe bricks in a similar fashion as the surrounding walls

72,ptolemys asia the english name asia was originally a concept of greek civilization the place name asia in various forms in a large number of modern languages is of unknown ultimate provenience its etymology and language of origin are uncertain it appears to be one of the most ancient of recorded names a number of theories have been published english asia can be traced through the formation of english literature to latin literature where it has the same form asia whether all uses and all forms of the name derive also from the latin of the roman empire is much less certain one of the first classical writers to use asia as a name of the whole continent was pliny this metonymical change in meaning is common and can be observed in some other geographical names such as skandinavia from scania bronze age before greek poetry the aegean sea area was in a greek dark age at the beginning of which syllabic writing was lost and alphabetic writing had not begun prior to then in the bronze age the records of the assyrian empire the hittite empire and the various mycenaean states of greece mention a region undoubtedly asia certainly in anatolia including if not identical to lydia these records are administrative and do not include poetry the mycenaean states were destroyed about 1200 bce by unknown agents although one school of thought assigns the dorian invasion to this time the burning of the palaces baked clay diurnal administrative records written in a greek syllabic script called linear b deciphered by a number of interested parties most notably by a young world war ii cryptographer michael ventris subsequently assisted by the scholar john chadwick a major cache discovered by carl blegen at the site of ancient pylos included hundreds of male and female names formed by different methods some of these are of women held in servitude as study of the society implied by the content reveals they were used in trades such as clothmaking and usually came with children the epithet lawiaiai captives associated with some of them identifies their origin some are ethnic names one in particular aswiai identifies women of asia perhaps they were captured in asia but some others milatiai appear to have been of miletus a greek colony which would not have been raided for slaves by greeks chadwick suggests that the names record the locations where these foreign women were purchased the name is also in the singular aswia which refers both to the name of a country and to a female of it there is a masculine form aswios this aswia appears to have been a remnant of a region known to the hittites as assuwa centered on lydia or roman asia this name assuwa has been suggested as the origin for the name of the continent asia the assuwa league was a confederation of states in western anatolia defeated by the hittites under tudhaliya i around 1400 bce alternatively the etymology of the term may be from the akkadian word waṣûm which means to go outside or to ascend referring to the direction of the sun at sunrise in the middle east and also likely connected with the phoenician word asa meaning east this may be contrasted to a similar etymology proposed for europe as being from akkadian erēbum to enter or set of the sun tr reid supports this alternative etymology noting that the ancient greek name must have derived from asu meaning east in assyrian ereb for europe meaning west the ideas of occidental form latin occidens setting and oriental from latin oriens for rising are also european invention synonymous with western and eastern reid further emphasizes that it explains the western point of view of placing all the peoples and cultures of asia into a single classification almost as if there were a need for setting the distinction between western and eastern civilizations on the eurasian continent ogura kazuo and tenshin okakura are two outspoken japanese figures on the subject classical antiquity asia highlighted in red within the roman empire latin asia and greek ἀσία appear to be the same word roman authors translated ἀσία as asia the romans named a province asia which roughly corresponds with modernday centralwestern turkey there was an asia minor and an asia major located in modernday iraq as the earliest evidence of the name is greek it is likely circumstantially that asia came from ἀσία but ancient transitions due to the lack of literary contexts are difficult to catch in the act the most likely vehicles were the ancient geographers and historians such as herodotus who were all greek ancient greek certainly evidences early and rich uses of the name the first continental use of asia is attributed to herodotus about 440 bce not because he innovated it but because his histories are the earliest surviving prose to describe it in any detail he defines it carefully mentioning the previous geographers whom he had read but whose works are now missing by it he means anatolia and the persian empire in contrast to greece and egypt herodotus comments that he is puzzled as to why three womens names were given to a tract which is in reality one europa asia and libya referring to africa stating that most greeks assumed that asia was named after the wife of prometheus ie hesione but that the lydians say it was named after asies son of cotys who passed the name on to a tribe at sardis in greek mythology asia ἀσία or asie ἀσίη was the name of a nymph or titan goddess of lydia in ancient greek religion places were under the care of female divinities parallel to guardian angels the poets detailed their doings and generations in allegoric language salted with entertaining stories which subsequently playwrights transformed into classical greek drama and became greek mythology for example hesiod mentions the daughters of tethys and ocean among whom are a holy company who with the lord apollo and the rivers have youths in their keeping many of these are geographic doris rhodea europa asia hesiod explainsfor there are threethousand neatankled daughters of ocean who are dispersed far and wide and in every place alike serve the earth and the deep waters the iliad attributed by the ancient greeks

74,on january 21 1786 the virginia legislature following james madisons recommendation invited all the states to send delegates to annapolis maryland to discuss ways to reduce interstate conflict at what came to be known as the annapolis convention the few state delegates in attendance endorsed a motion that called for all states to meet in philadelphia in may 1787 to discuss ways to improve the articles of confederation in a grand convention although the states representatives to the constitutional convention in philadelphia were only authorized to amend the articles the representatives held secret closeddoor sessions and wrote a new constitution the new constitution gave much more power to the central government but characterization of the result is disputed the general goal of the authors was to get close to a republic as defined by the philosophers of the age of enlightenment while trying to address the many difficulties of the interstate relationships historian forrest mcdonald using the ideas of james madison from federalist 39 describes the change this way in may 1786 charles pinckney of south carolina proposed that congress revise the articles of confederation recommended changes included granting congress power over foreign and domestic commerce and providing means for congress to collect money from state treasuries unanimous approval was necessary to make the alterations however and congress failed to reach a consensus the weakness of the articles in establishing an effective unifying government was underscored by the threat of internal conflict both within and between the states especially after shays rebellion threatened to topple the state government of massachusetts historian ralph ketcham comments on the opinions of patrick henry george mason and other antifederalists who were not so eager to give up the local autonomy won by the revolution historians have given many reasons for the perceived need to replace the articles in 1787 jillson and wilson 1994 point to the financial weakness as well as the norms rules and institutional structures of the congress and the propensity to divide along sectional lines rakove 1988 identifies several factors that explain the collapse of the confederation the lack of compulsory direct taxation power was objectionable to those wanting a strong centralized state or expecting to benefit from such power it could not collect customs after the war because tariffs were vetoed by rhode island rakove concludes that their failure to implement national measures stemmed not from a heady sense of independence but rather from the enormous difficulties that all the states encountered in collecting taxes mustering men and gathering supplies from a warweary populace the second group of factors rakove identified derived from the substantive nature of the problems the continental congress confronted after 1783 especially the inability to create a strong foreign policy finally the confederations lack of coercive power reduced the likelihood for profit to be made by political means thus potential rulers were uninspired to seek power when the war ended in 1783 certain special interests had incentives to create a new merchant state much like the british state people had rebelled against in particular holders of war scrip and land speculators wanted a central government to pay off scrip at face value and to legalize western land holdings with disputed claims also manufacturers wanted a high tariff as a barrier to foreign goods but competition among states made this impossible without a central government legitimacy of closing down political scientist david c hendrickson writes that two prominent political leaders in the confederation john jay of new york and thomas burke of north carolina believed that the authority of the congress rested on the prior acts of the several states to which the states gave their voluntary consent and until those obligations were fulfilled neither nullification of the authority of congress exercising its due powers nor secession from the compact itself was consistent with the terms of their original pledges according to article xiii of the confederation any alteration had to be approved unanimously the articles of this confederation shall be inviolably observed by every state and the union shall be perpetual nor shall any alteration at any time hereafter be made in any of them unless such alteration be agreed to in a congress of the united states and be afterwards confirmed by the legislatures of every state on the other hand article vii of the proposed constitution stated that it would become effective after ratification by a mere nine states without unanimity the ratification of the conventions of nine states shall be sufficient for the establishment of this constitution between the states so ratifying the same the apparent tension between these two provisions was addressed at the time and remains a topic of scholarly discussion in 1788 james madison remarked in federalist no 40 that the issue had become moot as this objectionhas been in a manner waived by those who have criticised the powers of the convention i dismiss it without further observation nevertheless it is an interesting historical and legal question whether opponents of the constitution could have plausibly attacked the constitution on that ground at the time there were state legislators who argued that the constitution was not an alteration of the articles of confederation but rather would be a complete replacement so the unanimity rule did not apply moreover the confederation had proven woefully inadequate and therefore was supposedly no longer binding modern scholars such as francisco forrest martin agree that the articles of confederation had lost its binding force because many states had violated it and thus other statesparties did not have to comply with the articles unanimous consent rule in contrast law professor akhil amar suggests that there may not have really been any conflict between the articles of confederation and the constitution on this point article vi of the confederation specifically allowed side deals among states and the constitution could be viewed as a side deal until all states ratified it final months on july 3 1788 the congress received new hampshires allimportant ninth ratification of the proposed constitution thus according to its terms establishing it as the new framework of governance for the ratifying states the following day delegates considered a bill to admit kentucky into the union as a sovereign state the discussion ended with congress making the determination that in light of this development it would be unadvisable to admit kentucky into the union as it could do so under the articles of confederation only but not under the constitution by the end of july 1788 11 of the 13 states had ratified the new constitution congress continued to convene under the articles with a quorum until october on saturday september 13 1788 the confederation congress voted the resolve to implement the new constitution and on monday september 15 published an announcement that the new constitution had been ratified by the necessary nine states set the first wednesday in february 1789 for the presidential electors to meet and select a new president and set the first wednesday of march 1789 as the day the new government would take over and the government under the articles of confederation would come to an end on that same september 13 it determined that new york would remain the national capital

74,the army the articles supported the congressional direction of the continental army and allowed the states to present a unified front when dealing with the european powers as a tool to build a centralized warmaking government they were largely a failure historian bruce chadwick wrote the continental congress before the articles were approved had promised soldiers a pension of half pay for life however congress had no power to compel the states to fund this obligation and as the war wound down after the victory at yorktown the sense of urgency to support the military was no longer a factor no progress was made in congress during the winter of 178384 general henry knox who would later become the first secretary of war under the constitution blamed the weaknesses of the articles for the inability of the government to fund the army the army had long been supportive of a strong union knox wrote as congress failed to act on the petitions knox wrote to gouverneur morris four years before the philadelphia convention was convened as the present constitution is so defective why do not you great men call the people together and tell them so that is to have a convention of the states to form a better constitution once the war had been won the continental army was largely disbanded a very small national force was maintained to man the frontier forts and to protect against native american attacks meanwhile each of the states had an army or militia and 11 of them had navies the wartime promises of bounties and land grants to be paid for service were not being met in 1783 george washington defused the newburgh conspiracy but riots by unpaid pennsylvania veterans forced congress to leave philadelphia temporarily the congress from time to time during the revolutionary war requisitioned troops from the states any contributions were voluntary and in the debates of 1788 the federalists who supported the proposed new constitution claimed that state politicians acted unilaterally and contributed when the continental army protected their states interests the antifederalists claimed that state politicians understood their duty to the union and contributed to advance its needs dougherty 2009 concludes that generally the states behavior validated the federalist analysis this helps explain why the articles of confederation needed reforms foreign policy even after peace had been achieved in 1783 the weakness of the confederation government frustrated the ability of the government to conduct foreign policy in 1789 thomas jefferson concerned over the failure to fund an american naval force to confront the barbary pirates wrote to james monroe it will be said there is no money in the treasury there never will be money in the treasury till the confederacy shows its teeth the states must see the rod furthermore the jaygardoqui treaty with spain in 1789 also showed weakness in foreign policy in this treaty which was never ratified due to its immense unpopularity the united states was to give up rights to use the mississippi river for 25 years which would have economically strangled the settlers west of the appalachian mountains finally due to the confederations military weakness it could not compel the british army to leave frontier forts which were on american soil forts which in 1783 the british promised to leave but which they delayed leaving pending us implementation of other provisions such as ending action against loyalists and allowing them to seek compensation this incomplete british implementation of the treaty of paris 1783 was superseded by the implementation of jays treaty in 1795 under the new us constitution taxation and commerce under the articles of confederation the central governments power was kept quite limited the confederation congress could make decisions but lacked enforcement powers implementation of most decisions including modifications to the articles required unanimous approval of all thirteen state legislatures congress was denied any powers of taxation it could only request money from the states the states often failed to meet these requests in full leaving both congress and the continental army chronically short of money as more money was printed by congress the continental dollars depreciated in 1779 george washington wrote to john jay who was serving as the president of the continental congress that a wagon load of money will scarcely purchase a wagon load of provisions mr jay and the congress responded in may by requesting 45 million from the states in an appeal to the states to comply jay wrote that the taxes were the price of liberty the peace and the safety of yourselves and posterity he argued that americans should avoid having it said that america had no sooner become independent than she became insolvent or that her infant glories and growing fame were obscured and tarnished by broken contracts and violated faith the states did not respond with any of the money requested from them congress had also been denied the power to regulate either foreign trade or interstate commerce and as a result all of the states maintained control over their own trade policies the states and the confederation congress both incurred large debts during the revolutionary war and how to repay those debts became a major issue of debate following the war some states paid off their war debts and others did not federal assumption of the states war debts became a major issue in the deliberations of the constitutional convention accomplishments of the confederation nevertheless the confederation congress did take two actions with longlasting impact the land ordinance of 1785 and northwest ordinance created territorial government set up protocols for the admission of new states and the division of land into useful units and set aside land in each township for public use this system represented a sharp break from imperial colonization as in europe and provided the basis for the rest of american continental expansion through the 19th century the land ordinance of 1785 established both the general practices of land surveying in the west and northwest and the land ownership provisions used throughout the later westward expansion beyond the mississippi river frontier lands were surveyed into the nowfamiliar squares of land called the township 36 square miles the section one square mile and the quarter section 160 acres this system was carried forward to most of the states west of the mississippi excluding areas of texas and california that had already been surveyed and divided up by the spanish empire then when the homestead act was enacted in 1867 the quarter section became the basic unit of land that was granted to new settlerfarmers the northwest ordinance of 1787 noted the agreement of the original states to give up northwestern land claims organized the northwest territory and laid the groundwork for the eventual creation of new states while it didnt happen under the articles the land north of the ohio river and west of the present western border of pennsylvania ceded by massachusetts connecticut new york pennsylvania and virginia eventually became the states of ohio indiana illinois michigan and wisconsin and the part of minnesota east of the mississippi river the northwest ordinance of 1787 also made great advances in the abolition of slavery new states admitted to the union in said territory would never be slave states no new states were admitted to the union under the articles of confederation the articles provided for a blanket acceptance of the province of quebec referred to as canada in the articles into the united states if it chose to do so it did not and the subsequent constitution carried no such special provision of admission additionally ordinances to admit frankland later modified to franklin kentucky and vermont to the union were considered but none were approved
74,the peace treaty left the united states independent and at peace but with an unsettled governmental structure the articles envisioned a permanent confederation but granted to the congressthe only federal institutionlittle power to finance itself or to ensure that its resolutions were enforced there was no president and no national court although historians generally agree that the articles were too weak to hold the fastgrowing nation together they do give credit to the settlement of the western issue as the states voluntarily turned over their lands to national control by 1783 with the end of the british blockade the new nation was regaining its prosperity however trade opportunities were restricted by the mercantilism of the british and french empires the ports of the british west indies were closed to all staple products which were not carried in british ships france and spain established similar policies simultaneously new manufacturers faced sharp competition from british products which were suddenly available again political unrest in several states and efforts by debtors to use popular government to erase their debts increased the anxiety of the political and economic elites which had led the revolution the apparent inability of the congress to redeem the public obligations debts incurred during the war or to become a forum for productive cooperation among the states to encourage commerce and economic development only aggravated a gloomy situation in 178687 shays rebellion an uprising of dissidents in western massachusetts against the state court system threatened the stability of state government the continental congress printed paper money which was so depreciated that it ceased to pass as currency spawning the expression not worth a continental congress could not levy taxes and could only make requisitions upon the states less than a million and a half dollars came into the treasury between 1781 and 1784 although the governors had been asked for two million in 1783 alone when john adams went to london in 1785 as the first representative of the united states he found it impossible to secure a treaty for unrestricted commerce demands were made for favors and there was no assurance that individual states would agree to a treaty adams stated it was necessary for the states to confer the power of passing navigation laws to congress or that the states themselves pass retaliatory acts against great britain congress had already requested and failed to get power over navigation laws meanwhile each state acted individually against great britain to little effect when other new england states closed their ports to british shipping connecticut hastened to profit by opening its ports by 1787 congress was unable to protect manufacturing and shipping state legislatures were unable or unwilling to resist attacks upon private contracts and public credit land speculators expected no rise in values when the government could not defend its borders nor protect its frontier population the idea of a convention to revise the articles of confederation grew in favor alexander hamilton realized while serving as washingtons top aide that a strong central government was necessary to avoid foreign intervention and allay the frustrations due to an ineffectual congress hamilton led a group of likeminded nationalists won washingtons endorsement and convened the annapolis convention in 1786 to petition congress to call a constitutional convention to meet in philadelphia to remedy the longterm crisis

the united states of america asserts the sovereignty of each state except for the specific powers delegated to the confederation government each state retains its sovereignty freedom and independence and every power jurisdiction and right which is not by this confederation expressly delegated declares the purpose of the confederation the said states hereby severally enter into a firm league of friendship with each other for their common defense the security of their liberties and their mutual and general welfare binding themselves to assist each other against all force offered to or attacks made upon them or any of them on account of religion sovereignty trade or any other pretense whatever elaborates upon the intent to secure and perpetuate mutual friendship and intercourse among the

vagabonds and fugitives from justice all these people are entitled to equal rights established by the state into which they travel if a crime is committed in one state and the perpetrator flees to another state he will be extradited to and tried in the state in which the crime was committed allocates one vote in the congress of the confederation the united states in congress assembled to each state which is entitled to a delegation of between two and seven members members of congress are to be appointed by state legislatures no congressman may serve more than three out of any six years only the central government may declare war or conduct foreign political or commercial relations no state or official may accept foreign gifts or titles and granting any title of nobility is forbidden to all no states may form any subnational groups no state may tax or interfere with treaty stipulations already proposed no state may wage war without permission of congress unless invaded or under imminent attack on the frontier no state may maintain a peacetime standing army or navy unless infested by pirates but every state is required to keep ready a welltrained disciplined and equipped militia whenever an army is raised for common defense the state legislatures shall assign military ranks of colonel and below expenditures by the united states of america will be paid with funds raised by state legislatures and apportioned to the states in proportion to the real property values of each powers and functions of the united states in congress assembled grants to the united states in congress assembled the sole and exclusive right and power to determine peace and war to exchange ambassadors to enter into treaties and alliances with some provisos to establish rules for deciding all cases of captures or prizes on land or water to grant letters of marque and reprisal documents authorizing privateers in times of peace to appoint courts for the trial of pirates and crimes committed on the high seas to establish courts for appeals in all cases of captures but no member of congress may be appointed a judge to set weights and measures including coins and for congress to serve as a final court for disputes between states the court will be composed of jointly appointed commissioners or congress shall appoint them each commissioner is bound by oath to be impartial the courts decision is final congress shall regulate the post offices appoint officers in the military and regulate the armed forces the united states in congress assembled may appoint a president who shall not serve longer than one year per threeyear term of the congress congress may request requisitions from the states in proportion with their population or take credit congress may not declare war enter into treaties and alliances appropriate money or appoint a commander in chief without nine states assented congress shall keep a journal of proceedings and adjourn for periods not to exceed six months when congress is in recess any of the powers of congress may be executed by the committee of the states or any nine of them except for those powers of congress which require nine states in congress to execute if canada as the britishheld province of quebec was also known accedes to this confederation it will be admitted no other colony could be admitted without the consent of nine states reaffirms that the confederation accepts war debt incurred by congress before the existence of the articles declares that the articles shall be perpetual and may be altered only with the approval of congress and the ratification of all the state legislatures while still at war with britain the revolutions leaders were divided between forming a national government with powers either strong and centralized the federalists or strictly limited the anti federalists the continental congress compromised by dividing sovereignty between the states and the central government with a unicameral legislature that protected the liberty of the individual states it empowered congress to regulate military and monetary affairs for example but provided no mechanism to compel the states to comply with requests for either troops or funding this left the military vulnerable to inadequate funding supplies or even food

76,the atlantic has contributed significantly to the development and economy of surrounding countries besides major transatlantic transportation and communication routes the atlantic offers abundant petroleum deposits in the sedimentary rocks of the continental shelves the atlantic harbors petroleum and gas fields fish marine mammals seals and whales sand and gravel aggregates placer deposits polymetallic nodules and precious stones gold deposits are a mile or two under water on the ocean floor however the deposits are also encased in rock that must be mined through currently there is no costeffective way to mine or extract gold from the ocean to make a profit various international treaties attempt to reduce pollution caused by environmental threats such as oil spills marine debris and the incineration of toxic wastes at sea fisheries the shelves of the atlantic hosts one of the worlds richest fishing resources the most productive areas include the grand banks of newfoundland the scotian shelf georges bank off cape cod the bahama banks the waters around iceland the irish sea the bay of fundy the dogger bank of the north sea and the falkland banks fisheries have however undergone significant changes since the 1950s and global catches can now be divided into three groups of which only two are observed in the atlantic fisheries in the eastern central and southwest atlantic oscillate around a globally stable value the rest of the atlantic is in overall decline following historical peaks the third group continuously increasing trend since 1950 is only found in the indian ocean and western pacific banks of the northeast atlantic in the northeast atlantic total catches decreased between the mid1970s and the 1990s and reached 87 million tons in 2013 blue whiting reached a 24 million tons peak in 2004 but was down to 628000 tons in 2013 recovery plans for cod sole and plaice have reduced mortality in these species arctic cod reached its lowest levels in the 1960s1980s but is now recovered arctic saithe and haddock are considered fully fished sand eel is overfished as was capelin which has now recovered to fully fished limited data makes the state of redfishes and deepwater species difficult to assess but most likely they remain vulnerable to overfishing stocks of northern shrimp and norwegian lobster are in good condition in the northeast atlantic 21 of stocks are considered overfished banks of the northwest atlantic in the northwest atlantic landings have decreased from 42 million tons in the early 1970s to 19 million tons in 2013 during the 21th century some species have shown weak signs of recovery including greenland halibut yellowtail flounder atlantic halibut haddock spiny dogfish while other stocks shown no such signs including cod witch flounder and redfish stocks of invertebrates in contrast remain at record levels of abundance 31 of stocks are overfished in the northwest atlantic capture of atlantic northwest cod in million tons in 1497 john cabot became the first to explore mainland north america and one of his major discoveries was the abundant resources of atlantic cod off newfoundland referred to as newfoundland currency this discovery supplied mankind with some 200 million tons of fish over five centuries in the late 19th and early 20th centuries new fisheries started to exploit haddock mackerel and lobster from the 1950s to the 1970s the introduction of european and asian distantwater fleets in the area dramatically increased the fishing capacity and number of exploited species it also expanded the exploited areas from nearshore to the open sea and to great depths to include deepwater species such as redfish greenland halibut witch flounder and grenadiers overfishing in the area was recognised as early as the 1960s but because this was occurring on international waters it took until the late 1970s before any attempts to regulate was made in the early 1990s this finally resulted in the collapse of the atlantic northwest cod fishery the population of a number of deepsea fishes also collapsed in the process including american plaice redfish and greenland halibut together with flounder and grenadier in the eastern central atlantic small pelagic fishes constitute about 50 of landings with sardine reaching 0610 million tons per year pelagic fish stocks are considered fully fishes or overfished with sardines south of cape bojador the notable exception almost half of stocks are fished at biologically unsustainable levels total catches have been fluctuating since the 1970s reaching 39 million tons in 2013 or slightly less than the peak production in 2010 bahama banks in the western central atlantic catches have been decreasing since 2000 and reached 13 million tons in 2013 the most important species in the area gulf menhaden reached a million tons in the mid1980s but only half a million tons in 2013 and is now considered fully fished round sardinella was an important species in the 1990s but is now considered overfished groupers and snappers are overfished and northern brown shrimp and american cupped oyster are considered fully fished approaching overfished 44 of stocks are being fished at unsustainable levels agulhas bank in the southeast atlantic catches have decreased from 33 million tons in the early 1970s to 13 million tons in 2013 horse mackerel and hake are the most important species together representing almost half of the landings off south africa and namibia deepwater hake and shallowwater cape hake have recovered to sustainable levels since regulations were introduced in 2006 and the states of southern african pilchard and anchovy have improved to fully fished in 2013 in the southwest atlantic a peak was reached in the mid1980s and catches now fluctuate between 17 and 26 million tons the most important species the argentine shortfin squid which reached half a million tons in 2013 or half the peak value is considered fully fished to overfished another important species was the brazilian sardinella with a production of 100000 tons in 2013 it is now considered overfished half the stocks in this area are being fished at unsustainable levels whiteheads round herring has not yet reached fully fished but cunene horse mackerel is overfished the sea snail perlemoen abalone is targeted by illegal fishing and remain overfished

circle surface water temperatures which vary with latitude current systems and season and reflect the latitudinal distribution of solar energy range from below to over maximum temperatures occur north of the equator and minimum values are found in the polar regions in the middle latitudes the area of maximum temperature variations values may vary by from october to june the surface is usually covered with sea ice in the labrador sea denmark strait and baltic sea the coriolis effect circulates north atlantic water in a clockwise direction whereas south atlantic water circulates counterclockwise the south tides in the atlantic ocean are semidiurnal that is two high tides occur during each 24 lunar hours in latitudes above 40 north some eastwest oscillation known as the north atlantic oscillation occurs salinity on average the atlantic is the saltiest major ocean surface water salinity in the open ocean ranges from 33 to 37 parts per thousand 33 37 by mass and varies with latitude and season evaporation precipitation river inflow and sea ice melting influence surface salinity values although the lowest salinity values are just north of the equator because of heavy tropical rainfall in general the lowest values are in the high latitudes and along coasts where large rivers enter maximum salinity values occur at about 25 north and south in subtropical regions with low rainfall and high evaporation the high surface salinity in the atlantic on which the atlantic thermohaline circulation is dependent is maintained by two processes the agulhas leakagerings which

temperature and salinity the atlantic subarctic upper water in the northernmost north atlantic is the source for subarctic intermediate water and north atlantic intermediate water north atlantic central water can be divided into the eastern and western north atlantic central water since the western part is strongly affected by the gulf stream and therefore the upper layer is closer to underlying fresher subpolar intermediate water the eastern water is saltier because of its proximity to mediterranean water north atlantic central water flows into south atlantic central water at 15n there are five intermediate waters four lowsalinity waters formed at subpolar latitudes and one highsalinity formed through evaporation arctic intermediate water flows from north to become the source for north atlantic deep water south of the greenlandscotland sill these two intermediate waters have different salinity in the western and eastern basins the wide range of salinities in the north atlantic is caused by the asymmetry of the northern subtropical gyre and the large number of contributions from a wide range of sources labrador sea norwegiangreenland sea mediterranean and south atlantic intermediate water the north atlantic deep water nadw is a complex of four water masses two that form by deep convection in the open ocean classical and upper labrador sea water and two that form from the inflow of dense water across the greenlandicelandscotland sill denmark strait and icelandscotland overflow water along its path across earth the composition of the nadw is affected by other water masses especially antarctic bottom water and mediterranean overflow water the nadw is fed by a flow of warm shallow water into the northern north atlantic which is responsible for the anomalous warm climate in europe changes in the formation of nadw have been linked to global climate changes in the past since manmade substances were introduced into the environment the path of the nadw can be traced throughout its course by measuring tritium and radiocarbon from nuclear weapon tests in the 1960s and cfcs gyres gyresaltmap showing 5 circles the first is between western australia

warmwater north atlantic gyre occupies the northern atlantic and the counterclockwise warmwater south atlantic gyre appears in the southern atlantic in the north atlantic surface circulation is dominated by three interconnected currents the gulf stream which flows northeast from the north american coast at cape hatteras the north atlantic current a branch of the gulf stream which flows northward from the grand banks and the subpolar front an extension of the north atlantic current a wide vaguely defined region separating the subtropical gyre from the subpolar gyre this system of currents transport warm water into the north atlantic without which temperatures in the north atlantic and europe would plunge dramatically in the subpolar gyre of the north atlantic warm subtropical waters are transformed into colder subpolar and polar waters in the labrador sea this water flows back to the subtropical gyre north of the north atlantic gyre the cyclonic north atlantic subpolar gyre plays a key role in climate variability it is governed by ocean currents from marginal seas and regional topography rather than being steered by wind both in the deep ocean and at sea level the subpolar gyre forms an important part of the global thermohaline circulation its eastern portion includes eddying branches of the north atlantic current which transport warm saline waters from the subtropics to the northeastern atlantic there this water is cooled during winter and forms return currents that merge along the eastern continental slope of greenland where they form an intense 4050 sv current which flows around the continental margins of the labrador sea a third of this water become parts of the deep portion of the north atlantic deep water nadw the nadw in its turn feed the meridional overturning circulation moc the northward heat transport of which is threatened by anthropogenic climate change large variations in the subpolar gyre on a decadecentury scale associated with the north atlantic oscillation are especially pronounced in labrador sea water the upper layers of the moc the south atlantic is dominated by the anticyclonic southern subtropical gyre the south atlantic central water originates in this gyre while antarctic intermediate water originates in the upper layers of the circumpolar region near the drake passage and falkland islands both these currents receive some contribution from the indian ocean on the african east coast the small cyclonic angola gyre lies embedded in the large subtropical gyre the southern subtropical gyre is partly masked by a windinduced ekman layer the residence time of the gyre is 4485 years north atlantic deep water flows southerward below the thermocline of the subtropical gyre sargasso sea approximate extent of the sargasso sea the sargasso sea in the western north atlantic can be defined as the area where two species of sargassum s fluitans and natans float an area wide and encircled by the gulf stream north atlantic drift and north equatorial current this population of seaweed probably originated from tertiary ancestors on the european shores of the former tethys ocean and has if so maintained itself by vegetative growth floating in the ocean for millions of years sargassum fish histrio histrio other species endemic to the sargasso sea include the sargassum fish a predator with algaelike appendages who hovers motionless among the sargassum fossils of similar fishes have been found in fossil bays of the former tethys ocean in what is now the carpathian region that were similar to the sargasso sea it is possible that the population in the sargasso sea migrated to the atlantic as the tethys closed at the end of the miocene around 17 ma the origin of the sargasso fauna and flora remained enigmatic for centuries the fossils found in the carpathians in the mid20th century often called the quasisargasso assemblage finally showed that this assemblage originated in the carpathian basin from were it migrated over sicily to the central atlantic where it evolved into modern species of the sargasso sea the location of the spawning ground for european eels remained unknown for decades in the early 19th century it was discovered that the southern sargasso sea is the spawning ground for both the european and american eel and that the former migrate more than and

76,the breakup of pangaea resulted in the opening of the atlantic ocean in three stages central atlantic the breakup of pangaea began in the central atlantic between north america and northwest africa where rift basins opened during the late triassic and early jurassic this period also saw the first stages of the uplift of the atlas mountains the exact timing is controversial with estimates ranging from 200 to 170 ma the opening of the atlantic ocean coincided with the initial breakup of the supercontinent pangaea both of which were initiated by the eruption of the central atlantic magmatic province camp one of the most extensive and voluminous large igneous provinces in earths history associated with the triassicjurassic extinction event one of earths major extinction events theoliitic dikes sills and lava flows from the camp eruption at 200 ma have been found in west africa eastern north america and northern south america the extent of the volcanism has been estimated to of which covered what is now northern and central brazil the formation of the central american isthmus closed the central american seaway at the end of the pliocene 28 ma ago the formation of the isthmus resulted in the migration and extinction of many landliving animals known as the great american interchange but the closure of the seaway resulted in a great american schism as it affected ocean currents salinity and temperatures in both the atlantic and pacific marine organisms on both sides of the isthmus became isolated and either diverged or went extinct geologically the northern atlantic is the area delimited to the south by two conjugate margins newfoundland and iberia and to the north by the arctic eurasian basin the opening of the northern atlantic closely followed the margins of its predecessor the iapetus ocean and spread from the central atlantic in six stages iberianewfoundland porcupinenorth america eurasiagreenland eurasianorth america active and inactive spreading systems in this area are marked by the interaction with the iceland hotspot south atlantic west gondwana south america and africa broke up in the early cretaceous to form the south atlantic the apparent fit between the coastlines of the two continents was noted on the first maps that included the south atlantic and it was also the subject of the first computerassisted plate tectonic reconstructions in 1965 this magnificent fit however has since then proven problematic and later reconstructions have introduced various deformation zones along the shorelines to accommodate the northwardpropagating breakup intracontinental rifts and deformations have also been introduced to subdivide both continental plates into subplates geologically the south atlantic can be divided into four segments equatorial segment from 10n to the romanche fracture zone rfz central segment from rfz to florianopolis fracture zone ffz north of walvis ridge and rio grande rise southern segment from ffz to the agulhasfalkland fracture zone affz and falkland segment south of affz in the southern segment the early cretaceous 133130 ma intensive magmatism of the paranáetendeka large igneous province produced by the tristan hotspot resulted in an estimated volume of it covered an area of in brazil paraguay and uruguay and in africa dyke swarms in brazil angola eastern paraguay and namibia however suggest the lip originally covered a much larger area and also indicate failed rifts in all these areas associated offshore basaltic flows reach as far south as the falkland islands and south africa traces of magmatism in both offshore and onshore basins in the central and southern segments have been dated to 14749 ma with two peaks between 143121 ma and 9060 ma in the falkland segment rifting began with dextral movements between the patagonia and colorado subplates between the early jurassic 190 ma and the early cretaceous 1267 ma around 150 ma seafloor spreading propagated northward into the southern segment no later than 130 ma rifting had reached the walvis ridgerio grande rise in the central segment rifting started to break africa in two by opening the benue trough around 118 ma rifting in the central segment however coincided with the cretaceous normal superchron also known as the cretaceous quiet period a 40 ma period without magnetic reversals which makes it difficult to date seafloor spreading in this segment the equatorial segment is the last phase of the breakup but because it is located on the equator magnetic anomalies cannot be used for dating various estimates date the propagation of seafloor spreading in this segment to the period 12096 ma this final stage nevertheless coincided with or resulted in the end of continental extension in africa about 50 ma the opening of the drake passage resulted from a change in the motions and separation rate of the south american and antarctic plates first small ocean basins opened and a shallow gateway appeared during the middle eocene 3430 ma a deeper seaway developed followed by an eoceneoligocene climatic deterioration and the growth of the antarctic ice sheet closure of the atlantic an embryonic subduction margin is potentially developing west of gibraltar the gibraltar arc in the western mediterranean is migrating westward into the central atlantic where it joins the converging african and eurasian plates together these three tectonic forces are slowly developing into a new subduction system in the eastern atlantic basin meanwhile the scotia arc and caribbean plate in the western atlantic basin are eastwardpropagating subduction systems that might together with the gibraltar system represent the beginning of the closure of the atlantic ocean and the final stage of the atlantic wilson cycle
76,human origin humans evolved in africa first by diverging from other apes around 7 ma then developing stone tools around 26 ma to finally evolve as modern humans around 100 kya the earliest evidences for the complex behavior associated with this behavioral modernity has been found in the greater cape floristic region gcfr along the coast of south africa during the latest glacial stages the nowsubmerged plains of the agulhas bank were exposed above sea level extending the south african coastline farther south by hundreds of kilometers a small population of modern humans probably fewer than a thousand reproducing individuals survived glacial maxima by exploring the high diversity offered by these palaeoagulhas plains the gcfr is delimited to the north by the cape fold belt and the limited space south of it resulted in the development of social networks out of which complex stone age technologies emerged human history thus begins on the coasts of south africa where the atlantic benguela upwelling and indian ocean agulhas current meet to produce an intertidal zone on which shellfish fur seal fishes and sea birds provided the necessary protein sources the african origin of this modern behaviour is evidenced by 70000 yearsold engravings from blombos cave south africa old world mitochondrial dna mtdna studies indicate that 8060000 years ago a major demographic expansion within africa derived from a single small population coincided with the emergence of behavioral complexity and the rapid mis 54 environmental changes this group of people not only expanded over the whole of africa but also started to disperse out of africa into asia europe and australasia around 65000 years ago and quickly replaced the archaic humans in these regions during the last glacial maximum lgm 20000 years ago humans had to abandon their initial settlements along the european north atlantic coast and retreat to the mediterranean following rapid climate changes at the end of the lgm this region was repopulated by magdalenian culture other huntergatherers followed in waves interrupted by largescale hazards such as the laacher see volcanic eruption the inundation of doggerland now the north sea and the formation of the baltic sea the european coasts of the north atlantic were permanently populated about 985 thousand years ago this human dispersal left abundant traces along the coasts of the atlantic ocean 50 kaold deeply stratified shell middens found in ysterfontein on the western coast of south africa are associated with the middle stone age msa the msa population was small and dispersed and the rate of their reproduction and exploitation was less intense than those of later generations while their middens resemble 1211 kaold late stone age lsa middens found on every inhabited continent the 5045 kaold enkapune ya muto in kenya probably represents the oldest traces of the first modern humans to disperse out of africa ertebølle middens in 1880 the same development can be seen in europe in la riera cave 2313 ka in asturias spain only some 26600 molluscs were deposited over 10 ka in contrast 87 kaold shell middens in portugal denmark and brazil generated thousands of tons of debris and artefacts the ertebølle middens in denmark for example accumulated of shell deposits representing some 50 million molluscs over only a thousand years this intensification in the exploitation of marine resources has been described as accompanied by new technologies such as boats harpoons and fishhooks because many caves found in the mediterranean and on the european atlantic coast have increased quantities of marine shells in their upper levels and reduced quantities in their lower the earliest exploitation however took place on the now submerged shelves and most settlements now excavated were then located several kilometers from these shelves the reduced quantities of shells in the lower levels can represent the few shells that were exported inland new world during the lgm the laurentide ice sheet covered most of northern north america while beringia connected siberia to alaska in 1973 late us geoscientist paul s martin proposed a blitzkrieg colonization of america by which clovis hunters migrated into north america around 13000 years ago in a single wave through an icefree corridor in the ice sheet and spread southward explosively briefly attaining a density sufficiently large to overkill much of their prey others later proposed a threewave migration over the bering land bridge these hypotheses remained the longheld view regarding the settlement of the americas a view challenged by more recent archaeological discoveries the oldest archaeological sites in the americas have been found in south america sites in northeast siberia report virtually no human presence there during the lgm and most clovis artefacts have been found in eastern north america along the atlantic coast furthermore colonisation models based on mtdna ydna and atdna data respectively support neither the blitzkrieg nor the threewave hypotheses but they also deliver mutually ambiguous results contradictory data from archaeology and genetics will most likely deliver future hypotheses that will eventually confirm each other a proposed route across the pacific to south america could explain early south american finds and another hypothesis proposes a northern path through the canadian arctic and down the north american atlantic coast early settlements across the atlantic have been suggested by alternative theories ranging from purely hypothetical to mostly disputed including the solutrean hypothesis and some of the precolumbian transoceanic contact theories íslendingasögur sagas including the grœnlendinga saga this interpretative map of the norse world shows that norse knowledge of america and the atlantic remained limited the norse settlement of the faroe islands and iceland began during the 9th and 10th centuries a settlement on greenland was established before 1000 ce but contact with it was lost in 1409 and it was finally abandoned during the early little ice age this setback was caused by a range of factors an unsustainable economy resulted in erosion and denudation while conflicts with the local inuit resulted in the failure to adapt their arctic technologies a colder climate resulted in starvation and the colony got economically marginalized as the great plague and barbary pirates harvested its victims on iceland in the 15th century iceland was initially settled 865930 ce following a warm period when winter temperatures hovered around which made farming favorable at high latitudes this did not last however and temperatures quickly dropped at 1080 ce summer temperatures had reached a maximum of the landnámabók book of settlement records disastrous famines during the first century of settlement men ate foxes and ravens and the old and helpless were killed and thrown over cliffs and by the early 1200s hay had to be abandoned for shortseason crops such as barley atlantic world a century after columbus first voyage large parts of the new world had been included into the spanish empire christopher columbus discovered the americas in 1492 under spanish flag six years later vasco da gama reached india under portuguese flag by navigating south around the cape of good hope thus proving that the atlantic and indian oceans are connected in 1500 in his voyage to india following vasco da gama pedro alvares cabral reached brazil taken by the currents of the south atlantic gyre following these explorations spain and portugal quickly conquered and colonized large territories in the new world and forced the native american population into slavery in order to explore the vast quantities of silver and gold they found spain and portugal monopolized this trade in order to keep other european nations out but conflicting interests nevertheless lead to a series of spanishportuguese wars a peace treaty mediated by the pope divided the conquered territories into spanish and portuguese sectors while keeping other colonial powers away england france and the dutch republic enviously watched the spanish and portuguese wealth grow and allied themselves with pirates such as henry mainwaring and alexandre exquemelin they could explore the convoys leaving america because prevailing winds and currents made the transport of heavy metals slow and predictable embarked and disembarked slaves in the atlantic slave trade 15251863 first and last slave voyages in the american colonies depredation disease and slavery quickly reduced the indigenous american population to the extent that the atlantic slave trade had to be introduced to replace them a trade that became norm and an integral part of the colonization between the 15th century and 1888 when brazil became the last part of america to end slave trade an estimated ten million africans were exported as slaves most of them destined for agricultural labour the slave trade was officially abolished in the british empire and the united states in 1808 and slavery itself was abolished in the british empire in 1838 and in the us in 1865 after the civil war from columbus to the industrial revolution transatlantic trade including colonialism and slavery became crucial for western europe for european countries with a direct access to the atlantic including britain france the netherlands portugal and spain 15001800 was a period of sustained growth during which these countries grew richer than those in eastern europe and asia colonialism evolved as part of the transatlantic trade but this trade also strengthened the position of merchant groups at the expense of monarchs growth was more rapid in nonabsolutist countries such as britain and the netherlands and more limited in absolutist monarchies such as portugal spain and france where profit mostly or exclusively benefited the monarchy and its allies transatlantic trade also resulted in an increasing urbanization in european countries facing the atlantic urbanization grew from 8 in 1300 101 in 1500 to 245 in 1850 in other european countries from 10 in 1300 114 in 1500 to 17 in 1850 likewise gdp doubled in atlantic countries but rose by only 30 in the rest of europe by end of the 17th century the volume of the transatlantic trade had surpassed that of the mediterranean trade
77,arthur schopenhauer 22 february 1788 21 september 1860 was a german philosopher he is best known for his 1818 work the world as will and representation expanded in 1844 wherein he characterizes the phenomenal world as the product of a blind and insatiable metaphysical will proceeding from the transcendental idealism of immanuel kant schopenhauer developed an atheistic metaphysical and ethical system that has been described as an exemplary manifestation of philosophical pessimism rejecting the contemporaneous postkantian philosophies of german idealism schopenhauer was among the first thinkers in western philosophy to share and affirm significant tenets of eastern philosophy eg asceticism the worldasappearance having initially arrived at similar conclusions as the result of his own philosophical work though his work failed to garner substantial attention during his life schopenhauer has had a posthumous impact across various disciplines including philosophy literature and science his writing on aesthetics morality and psychology would exert important influence on thinkers and artists throughout the 19th and 20th centuries those who have cited his influence include friedrich nietzsche richard wagner leo tolstoy ludwig wittgenstein erwin schrödinger otto rank gustav mahler joseph campbell albert einstein carl jung thomas mann emile zola guy de maupassant jorge luis borges and samuel beckett among others a thinker who was widely believed to have been influenced by schopenhauer but denied it was george bernard shaw
77,schopenhauer at age 71 in march 1859 critique of the kantian philosophy schopenhauer accepted kants doubleaspect of the universethe phenomenal world of experience and the noumenal the true world independent of experience some commentators suggest that schopenhauer claimed that the noumenon or thinginitself was the basis for schopenhauers concept of the will other commentators suggest that schopenhauer considered will to be only a subset of the thinginitself class namely that which we can most directly experience schopenhauers identification of the kantian noumenon ie the actually existing entity with what he termed will deserves some explanation the noumenon was what kant called the ding an sich the thing in itself the reality that is the foundation of our sensory and mental representations of an external world in kantian terms those sensory and mental representations are mere phenomena schopenhauer departed from kant in his description of the relationship between the phenomenon and the noumenon according to kant thingsinthemselves ground the phenomenal representations in our minds schopenhauer on the other hand believed that phenomena and noumena are two different sides of the same coin noumena do not cause phenomena but rather phenomena are simply the way by which our minds perceive the noumena according to the principle of sufficient reason this is explained more fully in schopenhauers doctoral thesis on the fourfold root of the principle of sufficient reason 1813 schopenhauers second major departure from kants epistemology concerns the body kants philosophy was formulated as a response to the radical philosophical skepticism of david hume who claimed that causality could not be observed empirically schopenhauer begins by arguing that kants demarcation between external objects knowable only as phenomena and the thing in itself of noumenon contains a significant omission there is in fact one physical object we know more intimately than we know any object of sense perception our own body we know our human bodies have boundaries and occupy space the same way other objects known only through our named senses do though we seldom think of our body as a physical object we know even before reflection that it shares some of an objects properties we understand that a watermelon cannot successfully occupy the same space as an oncoming truck we know that if we tried to repeat the experiment with our own body we would obtain similar resultswe know this even if we do not understand the physics involved we know that our consciousness inhabits a physical body similar to other physical objects only known as phenomena yet our consciousness is not commensurate with our body most of us possess the power of voluntary motion we usually are not aware of the breathing of our lungs or the beating of our heart unless somehow our attention is called to them our ability to control either is limited our kidneys command our attention on their schedule rather than one we choose few of us have any idea what our liver is doing right now though this organ is as needful as lungs heart or kidneys the conscious mind is the servant not the master of these and other organs these organs have an agenda the conscious mind did not choose and over which it has limited power when schopenhauer identifies the noumenon with the desires needs and impulses in us that we name will what he is saying is that we participate in the reality of an otherwise unachievable world outside the mind through will we cannot prove that our mental picture of an outside world corresponds with a reality by reasoning through will we knowwithout thinkingthat the world can stimulate us we suffer fear or desire these states arise involuntarily they arise prior to reflection they arise even when the conscious mind would prefer to hold them at bay the rational mind is for schopenhauer a leaf borne along in a stream of prereflective and largely unconscious emotion that stream is will and through will if not through logic we can participate in the underlying reality beyond mere phenomena it is for this reason that schopenhauer identifies the noumenon with what we call our will in his criticism of kant schopenhauer claimed that sensation and understanding are separate and distinct abilities yet for kant an object is known through each of them kant wrote there are two stems of human knowledge namely sensibility and understanding objects being given by the former sensibility and thought by the latter understanding schopenhauer disagreed he asserted that mere sense impressions not objects are given by sensibility according to schopenhauer objects are intuitively perceived by understanding and are discursively thought by reason kant had claimed that 1 the understanding thinks objects through concepts and that 2 reason seeks the unconditioned or ultimate answer to why schopenhauer said that kants mistake regarding perception resulted in all of the obscurity and difficult confusion that is exhibited in the transcendental analytic section of his critique lastly schopenhauer departed from kant in how he interpreted the platonic ideas in the world as will and representation schopenhauer explicitly stated kant used the word idea wrongly as well as illegitimately although plato had already taken possession of it and used it most appropriately instead schopenhauer relied upon the neoplatonist interpretation of the biographer diogenes laërtius from lives and opinions of eminent philosophers in reference to platos ideas schopenhauer quotes laërtius verbatim in an explanatory footnote diogenes laërtius iii 12 plato ideas in natura velut exemplaria dixit subsistere cetera his esse similia ad istarum similitudinem consistencia plato teaches that the ideas exist in nature so to speak as patterns or prototypes and that the remainder of things only resemble them and exist as their copies critique of hegel schopenhauer expressed his dislike for the philosophy of his contemporary georg wilhelm friedrich hegel many times in his published works the following quotations are typical if i were to say that the socalled philosophy of this fellow hegel is a colossal piece of mystification which will yet provide posterity with an inexhaustible theme for laughter at our times that it is a pseudophilosophy paralyzing all mental powers stifling all real thinking and by the most outrageous misuse of language putting in its place the hollowest most senseless thoughtless and as is confirmed by its success most stupefying verbiage i should be quite right further if i were to say that this summus philosophus scribbled nonsense quite unlike any mortal before him so that whoever could read his most eulogized work the socalled phenomenology of the mind without feeling as if he were in a madhouse would qualify as an inmate for bedlam i should be no less right at first fichte and schelling shine as the heroes of this epoch to be followed by the man who is quite unworthy even of them and greatly their inferior in point of talenti mean the stupid and clumsy charlatan hegel in his foreword to the first edition of his work die beiden grundprobleme der ethik schopenhauer suggested that he had shown hegel to have fallen prey to the post hoc ergo propter hoc fallacy schopenhauer suggested that hegels works were filled with castles of abstraction and that hegel used deliberately impressive but ultimately vacuous verbiage he also thought that his glorification of church and state were designed for personal advantage and had little to do with the search for philosophical truth for instance the right hegelians interpreted hegel as viewing the prussian state of his day as perfect and the goal of all history up until then

77,schopenhauer said he was influenced by the upanishads immanuel kant and plato references to eastern philosophy and religion appear frequently in his writing as noted above he appreciated the teachings of the buddha and even called himself a buddhist he said that his philosophy could not have been conceived before these teachings were available concerning the upanishads and vedas he writes in the world as will and representation if the reader has also received the benefit of the vedas the access to which by means of the upanishads is in my eyes the greatest privilege which this still young century 1818 may claim before all previous centuries if then the reader i say has received his initiation in primeval indian wisdom and received it with an open heart he will be prepared in the very best way for hearing what i have to tell him it will not sound to him strange as to many others much less disagreeable for i might if it did not sound conceited contend that every one of the detached statements which constitute the upanishads may be deduced as a necessary result from the fundamental thoughts which i have to enunciate though those deductions themselves are by no means to be found there among schopenhauers other influences were shakespeare jeanjacques rousseau john locke thomas reid baruch spinoza matthias claudius george berkeley david hume and rené descartes

gdańsk poland on heiligegeistgasse known in the present day as św ducha 47 the son of johanna schopenhauer née trosiener and heinrich floris schopenhauer both descendants of wealthy german patrician families when danzig became part of prussia in 1793 heinrich moved to hamburg although his firm continued trading in danzig as early as 1799 arthur started playing the flute in 1805 schopenhauers father died possibly by suicide arthur endured two long years of drudgery as a merchant in honor of his dead father but his mother soon moved with his sister adele to weimarthen the centre of german literatureto pursue her writing career he dedicated himself wholly to studies at the gotha gymnasium in saxegothaaltenburg but left in disgust after seeing one of the masters lampooned schopenhauer as a youth by that time johanna schopenhauer had already opened her famous salon and arthur was not compatible with what he considered its vain and ceremonious ways he was also disgusted by the ease with which his mother had forgotten his fathers memory he left to become a student at the university of göttingen in 1809 there he studied metaphysics and psychology under gottlob ernst schulze the author of aenesidemus who advised him to concentrate on plato and immanuel kant in berlin from 1811 to 1812 he had attended lectures by the prominent postkantian philosopher johann gottlieb fichte and the theologian friedrich schleiermacher schopenhauer had a notably strained relationship with his mother johanna he wrote his first book on the fourfold root of the principle of sufficient reason while at university his mother informed him that the book was incomprehensible and it was unlikely that anyone would ever buy a copy in a fit of temper arthur schopenhauer told her that his work would be read long after the rubbish she wrote would have been totally forgotten in fact although they considered her novels of dubious quality the brockhaus publishing firm held her in high esteem because they consistently sold well hans brockhaus later recalled that when she brought them some of her sons work his predecessors saw nothing in this manuscript but wanted to please one of our bestselling authors by publishing her sons work we published more and more of her son arthurs work and today nobody remembers johanna but her sons works are in steady demand and contribute to brockhauss reputation he kept large portraits of the pair in his office in leipzig for the edification of his new editors in 1814 schopenhauer began his seminal work the world as will and representation die welt als wille und vorstellung he finished it in 1818 and brockhaus published it that december in dresden in 1819 schopenhauer fathered with a servant an illegitimate daughter who was born and died the same year in 1820 schopenhauer became a lecturer at the university of berlin he scheduled his lectures to coincide with those of the famous philosopher g w f hegel whom schopenhauer described as a clumsy charlatan however only five students turned up to schopenhauers lectures and he dropped out of academia a late essay on university philosophy expressed his resentment towards the work conducted in academies while in berlin schopenhauer was named as a defendant in a lawsuit initiated by a woman named caroline marquet she asked for damages alleging that schopenhauer had pushed her according to schopenhauers court testimony she deliberately annoyed him by raising her voice while standing right outside his door marquet alleged that the philosopher had assaulted and battered her after she refused to leave his doorway her companion testified that she saw marquet prostrate outside his apartment because marquet won the lawsuit schopenhauer made payments to her for the next twenty years when she died he wrote on a copy of her death certificate obit anus abit onus the old woman dies the burden is lifted in 1819 the fortunes of his mother and sister and himself were threatened by the failure of the firm in danzig in which his father had been a director and shareholder his sister accepted a compromise compensation package of 70 per cent but schopenhauer angrily refused this and eventually recovered 9400 thalers in 1821 he fell in love with nineteenyearold opera singer caroline richter called medon and had a relationship with her for several years but did not marry her when he was fortythree years old he took interest in seventeenyearold flora weiss but she rejected him as recorded in her diary grave at frankfurt hauptfriedhof in 1831 a cholera epidemic broke out in berlin and schopenhauer left the city schopenhauer settled permanently in frankfurt in 1833 where he remained for the next twentyseven years living alone except for a succession of pet poodles named atman and butz the numerous notes that he made during these years amongst others on aging were published posthumously under the title senilia schopenhauer had a robust constitution but in 1860 his health began to deteriorate he died of pulmonaryrespiratory failure on 21 september 1860 while sitting at home on his couch he was 72

77,caricature of schopenhauer by wilhelm busch 18321908 schopenhauer has had a massive influence upon later thinkers though more so in the arts especially literature and music and psychology than in philosophy his popularity peaked in the early twentieth century especially during the modernist era and waned somewhat thereafter nevertheless a number of recent publications have reinterpreted and modernised the study of schopenhauer his theory is also being explored by some modern philosophers as a precursor to evolutionary theory and modern evolutionary psychology russian writer and philosopher leo tolstoy was greatly influenced by schopenhauer after reading schopenhauers the world as will and representation tolstoy gradually became converted to the ascetic morality upheld in that work as the proper spiritual path for the upper classes do you know what this summer has meant for me constant raptures over schopenhauer and a whole series of spiritual delights which ive never experienced before no student has ever studied so much on his course and learned so much as i have this summer richard wagner writing in his autobiography remembered his first impression that schopenhauer left on him when he read world as will and representation schopenhauers book was never completely out of my mind and by the following summer i had studied it from cover to cover four times it had a radical influence on my whole life wagner also commented on that serious mood which was trying to find ecstatic expression created by schopenhauer inspired the conception of tristan und isolde see also influence of schopenhauer on tristan und isolde friedrich nietzsche owed the awakening of his philosophical interest to reading the world as will and representation and admitted that he was one of the few philosophers that he respected dedicating to him his essay schopenhauer als erzieher one of his untimely meditations jorge luis borges remarked that the reason he had never attempted to write a systematic account of his world view despite his penchant for philosophy and metaphysics in particular was because schopenhauer had already written it for him as a teenager ludwig wittgenstein adopted schopenhauers epistemological idealism however after his study of the philosophy of mathematics he rejected epistemological idealism for gottlob freges conceptual realism in later years wittgenstein was highly dismissive of schopenhauer describing him as an ultimately shallow thinker schopenhauer has quite a crude mind where real depth starts his comes to an end the philosopher gilbert ryle read schopenhauers works as a student but later largely forgot them only to unwittingly recycle ideas from schopenhauer in his the concept of mind 1949
77,the british philosopher and historian bertrand russell deemed schopenhauer an insincere person because judging by his life he habitually dined well at a good restaurant he had many trivial loveaffairs which were sensual but not passionate he was exceedingly quarrelsome and unusually avaricious it is hard to find in his life evidences of any virtue except kindness to animals in all other respects he was completely selfish it is difficult to believe that a man who was profoundly convinced of the virtue of asceticism and resignation would never have made any attempt to embody his convictions in his practice bryan magee argues that the answer to such shallow but not uncommon criticism is found in a quotation from schopenhauer it is therefore just as little necessary for the saint to be a philosopher as for the philosopher to be a saint just as it is not necessary for a perfectly beautiful person to be a great sculptor or for a great sculptor to be himself a beautiful person in general it is a strange demand on a moralist that he should commend no other virtue than that which he himself possesses to repeat abstractly universally and distinctly in concepts the whole inner nature of the world and thus to deposit it as a reflected image in permanent concepts always ready for the faculty of reason this and nothing else is philosophy
77,philosophy of the will schopenhauer in 1815 second of the critical five years of the initial composition of die welt als wille und vorstellung portrait by ludwig sigismund ruhl a key focus of schopenhauer was his investigation of individual motivation before schopenhauer hegel had popularized the concept of zeitgeist the idea that society consisted of a collective consciousness that moved in a distinct direction dictating the actions of its members schopenhauer a reader of both kant and hegel criticized their logical optimism and the belief that individual morality could be determined by society and reason schopenhauer believed that humans were motivated by only their own basic desires or will to live which directed all of mankind will for schopenhauer is what kant called the thinginitself for schopenhauer human desire was futile illogical directionless and by extension so was all human action in the world einstein paraphrased his views as follows man can indeed do what he wants but he cannot will what he wants in this sense he adhered to the fichtean principle of idealism the world is for a subject this idealism so presented immediately commits it to an ethical attitude unlike the purely epistemological concerns of descartes and berkeley to schopenhauer the will is a blind force that controls not only the actions of individual intelligent agents but ultimately all observable phenomenaan evil to be terminated via mankinds duties asceticism and chastity he is credited with one of the most famous opening lines of philosophy the world is my representation friedrich nietzsche was greatly influenced by this idea of will although he eventually rejected it art and aesthetics for schopenhauer human desiring willing and craving cause suffering or pain a temporary way to escape this pain is through aesthetic contemplation a method comparable to zapffes sublimation aesthetic contemplation allows one to escape this painalbeit temporarilybecause it stops one perceiving the world as mere presentation instead one no longer perceives the world as an object of perception therefore as subject to the principle of sufficient grounds time space and causality from which one is separated rather one becomes one with that perception one can thus no longer separate the perceiver from the perception the world as will and representation section 34 from this immersion with the world one no longer views oneself as an individual who suffers in the world due to ones individual will but rather becomes a subject of cognition to a perception that is pure willless timeless section 34 where the essence ideas of the world are shown art is the practical consequence of this brief aesthetic contemplation as it attempts to depict ones immersion with the world thus tries to depict the essencepure ideas of the world music for schopenhauer was the purest form of art because it was the one that depicted the will itself without it appearing as subject to the principle of sufficient grounds therefore as an individual object according to daniel albright schopenhauer thought that music was the only art that did not merely copy ideas but actually embodied the will itself he deemed music a timeless universal language comprehended everywhere that can imbue global enthusiasm if in possession of a significant melody mathematics schopenhauers realist views on mathematics are evident in his criticism of the contemporary attempts to prove the parallel postulate in euclidean geometry writing shortly before the discovery of hyperbolic geometry demonstrated the logical independence of the axiomand long before the general theory of relativity revealed that it does not necessarily express a property of physical spaceschopenhauer criticized mathematicians for trying to use indirect concepts to prove what he held to be directly evident from perception throughout his writings schopenhauer criticized the logical derivation of philosophies and mathematics from mere concepts instead of from intuitive perceptions although schopenhauer could see no justification for trying to prove euclids parallel postulate he did see a reason for examining another of euclids axioms this follows kants reasoning ethics schopenhauers moral theory proposed that only compassion can drive moral acts according to schopenhauer compassion alone is the good of the object of the acts that is they cannot be inspired by either the prospect of personal utility or the feeling of duty mankind can also be guided by egoism and malice egotistic acts are those guided by selfinterest desire for pleasure or happiness schopenhauer believed most of our deeds belong to this class acts of malice are different from egotistic acts as in the case of acts of compassion these do not target personal utility their aim is to cause damage to others independently of personal gains he believed like swami vivekananda in the unity of all with oneself and also believed that ego is the origin of pain and conflicts that reduction of ego frames the moral principles punishment 1855 painting of schopenhauer by jules lunteschütz according to schopenhauer whenever we make a choice we assume as necessary that decision was preceded by something from which it ensued and which we call the ground or reason or more accurately the motive of the resultant action choices are not made freely our actions are necessary and determined because every human being even every animal after the motive has appeared must carry out the action which alone is in accordance with his inborn and immutable character a definite action inevitably results when a particular motive influences a persons given unchangeable character the state schopenhauer claimed punishes criminals to prevent future crimes it does so by placing beside every possible motive for committing a wrong a more powerful motive for leaving it undone in the inescapable punishment accordingly the criminal code is as complete a register as possible of countermotives to all criminal actions that can possibly be imagined should capital punishment be legal for safeguarding the lives of citizens he asserted capital punishment is therefore absolutely necessary the murderer wrote schopenhauer who is condemned to death according to the law must it is true be now used as a mere means and with complete right for public security which is the principal object of the state is disturbed by him indeed it is abolished if the law remains unfulfilled the murderer his life his person must be the means of fulfilling the law and thus of reestablishing public security schopenhauer disagreed with those who would abolish capital punishment those who would like to abolish it should be given the answer first remove murder from the world and then capital punishment ought to follow people according to schopenhauer cannot be improved they can only be influenced by strong motives that overpower criminal motives schopenhauer declared that real moral reform is not at all possible but only determent from the deed he claimed this doctrine was not original to him previously it appeared in the writings of plato seneca hobbes pufendorf and anselm feuerbach schopenhauer declared that their teaching was corrupted by subsequent errors and therefore was in need of clarification god even though schopenhauer ended his treatise on the freedom of human will with the postulate of everyones responsibility for their character and consequently actsthe responsibility following from ones being the will as noumenon from which also all the characters and creations comehe considered his views incompatible with theism on grounds of fatalism and more generally responsibility for evil in schopenhauers philosophy the dogmas of christianity lose their significance and the last judgment is no longer preceded by anythingthe world is itself the last judgment on it whereas god if he existed would be evil psychology philosophers have not traditionally been impressed by the tribulations of sex but schopenhauer addressed it and related concepts forthrightly one ought rather to be surprised that a thing sex which plays throughout so important a part in human life has hitherto practically been disregarded by philosophers altogether and lies before us as raw and untreated material he named a force within man that he felt took invariable precedence over reason the will to live or will to life wille zum leben defined as an inherent drive within human beings and indeed all creatures to stay alive a force that inveigles us into reproducing schopenhauer refused to conceive of love as either trifling or accidental but rather understood it as an immensely powerful force that lay unseen within mans psyche and dramatically shaped the world the ultimate aim of all love affairs is more important than all other aims in mans life and therefore it is quite worthy of the profound seriousness with which everyone pursues it what is decided by it is nothing less than the composition of the next generation these ideas foreshadowed the discovery of evolution freuds concepts of the libido and the unconscious mind and evolutionary psychology in general political and social thought politics bust in frankfurt am main schopenhauers politics were for the most part an echo of his system of ethics the latter being expressed in die beiden grundprobleme der ethik available in english as two separate books on the basis of morality and on the freedom of the will ethics also occupies about one quarter of his central work the world as will and representation in occasional political comments in his parerga and paralipomena and manuscript remains schopenhauer described himself as a proponent of limited government what was essential he thought was that the state should leave each man free to work out his own salvation and so long as government was thus limited he would prefer to be ruled by a lion than one of his fellow ratsie by a monarch rather than a democrat schopenhauer shared the view of thomas hobbes on the necessity of the state and of state action to check the destructive tendencies innate to our species he also defended the independence of the legislative judicial and executive branches of power and a monarch as an impartial element able to practise justice in a practical and everyday sense not a cosmological one he declared monarchy as that which is natural to man for intelligence has always under a monarchical government a much better chance against its irreconcilable and everpresent foe stupidity and disparaged republicanism as unnatural as it is unfavourable to the higher intellectual life and the arts and sciences schopenhauer by his own admission did not give much thought to politics and several times he writes proudly of how little attention he had paid to political affairs of his day in a life that spanned several revolutions in french and german government and a few continentshaking wars he did indeed maintain his aloof position of minding not the times but the eternities he wrote many disparaging remarks about germany and the germans a typical example is for a german it is even good to have somewhat lengthy words in his mouth for he thinks slowly and they give him time to reflect schopenhauer attributed civilizational primacy to the northern white races due to their sensitivity and creativity except for the ancient egyptians and hindus whom he saw as equal the highest civilization and culture apart from the ancient hindus and egyptians are found exclusively among the white races and even with many dark peoples the ruling caste or race is fairer in colour than the rest and has therefore evidently immigrated for example the brahmans the incas and the rulers of the south sea islands all this is due to the fact that necessity is the mother of invention because those tribes that emigrated early to the north and there gradually became white had to develop all their intellectual powers and invent and perfect all the arts in their struggle with need want and misery which in their many forms were brought about by the climate this they had to do in order to make up for the parsimony of nature and out of it all came their high civilization despite this he was adamantly against differing treatment of races was fervently antislavery and supported the abolitionist movement in the united states he describes the treatment of our innocent black brothers whom force and injustice have delivered into the slavemasters devilish clutches as belonging to the blackest pages of mankinds criminal record schopenhauer additionally maintained a marked metaphysical and political antijudaism schopenhauer argued that christianity constituted a revolt against what he styled the materialistic basis of judaism exhibiting an indianinfluenced ethics reflecting the aryanvedic theme of spiritual selfconquest this he saw as opposed to what he held to be the ignorant drive toward earthly utopianism and superficiality of a worldly jewish spirit while all other religions endeavor to explain to the people by symbols the metaphysical significance of life the religion of the jews is entirely immanent and furnishes nothing but a mere warcry in the struggle with other nations views on women in schopenhauers 1851 essay on women he expressed his opposition to what he called teutonicochristian stupidity of reflexive unexamined reverence abgeschmackten weiberveneration for the female schopenhauer wrote that women are directly fitted for acting as the nurses and teachers of our early childhood by the fact that they are themselves childish frivolous and shortsighted he opined that women are deficient in artistic faculties and sense of justice and expressed opposition to monogamy indeed rodgers and thompson in philosophers behaving badly call schopenhauer a misogynist without rival inwestern philosophy he claimed that woman is by nature meant to obey the essay does give some compliments however that women are decidedly more sober in their judgment than men are and are more sympathetic to the suffering of others schopenhauers controversial writings have influenced many from friedrich nietzsche to nineteenthcentury feminists schopenhauers biological analysis of the difference between the sexes and their separate roles in the struggle for survival and reproduction anticipates some of the claims that were later ventured by sociobiologists and evolutionary psychologists after the elderly schopenhauer sat for a sculpture portrait by elisabet ney he told richard wagners friend malwida von meysenbug i have not yet spoken my last word about women i believe that if a woman succeeds in withdrawing from the mass or rather raising herself above the mass she grows ceaselessly and more than a man heredity and eugenics schopenhauer at age 58 on 16 may 1846 note for clarity in the following that genetics are but one component of heredity though commonly used interchangeably heritable traits would include socioeconomic and other psychosocial potentialities see eg the difference between genetic and hereditary evolutionary biology schopenhauer believed that personality and intellect were inherited he quotes horaces saying from the brave and good are the brave descended odes iv 4 29 and shakespeares line from cymbeline cowards father cowards and base things sire base iv 2 to reinforce his hereditarian argument mechanistically schopenhauer believed that a person inherits his level of intellect through his mother and personal character through ones father this belief in heritability of traits informed schopenhauers view of love placing it at the highest level of importance for schopenhauer the final aim of all love intrigues be they comic or tragic is really of more importance than all other ends in human life what it all turns upon is nothing less than the composition of the next generation it is not the weal or woe of any one individual but that of the human race to come which is here at stake this view of the importance for the species of whom we choose to love was reflected in his views on eugenics or good breeding here schopenhauer wrote with our knowledge of the complete unalterability both of character and of mental faculties we are led to the view that a real and thorough improvement of the human race might be reached not so much from outside as from within not so much by theory and instruction as rather by the path of generation plato had something of the kind in mind when in the fifth book of his republic he explained his plan for increasing and improving his warrior caste if we could castrate all scoundrels and stick all stupid geese in a convent and give men of noble character a whole harem and procure men and indeed thorough men for all girls of intellect and understanding then a generation would soon arise which would produce a better age than that of pericles in another context schopenhauer reiterated his antidemocraticeugenic thesis if you want utopian plans i would say the only solution to the problem is the despotism of the wise and noble members of a genuine aristocracy a genuine nobility achieved by mating the most magnanimous men with the cleverest and most gifted women this proposal constitutes my utopia and my platonic republic analysts eg keith ansellpearson have suggested that schopenhauers advocacy of antiegalitarianism and eugenics influenced the neoaristocratic philosophy of friedrich nietzsche who initially considered schopenhauer his mentor animal welfare as a consequence of his monistic philosophy schopenhauer was very concerned about the welfare of animals for him all individual animals including humans are essentially the same being phenomenal manifestations of the one underlying will the word will designated for him force power impulse energy and desire it is the closest word we have that can signify both the real essence of all external things and also our own direct inner experience since every living thing possesses will then humans and animals are fundamentally the same and can recognize themselves in each other for this reason he claimed that a good person would have sympathy for animals who are our fellow sufferers compassion for animals is intimately associated with goodness of character and it may be confidently asserted that he who is cruel to living creatures cannot be a good man nothing leads more definitely to a recognition of the identity of the essential nature in animal and human phenomena than a study of zoology and anatomy the assumption that animals are without rights and the illusion that our treatment of them has no moral significance is a positively outrageous example of western crudity and barbarity universal compassion is the only guarantee of morality in 1841 he praised the establishment in london of the society for the prevention of cruelty to animals and also the animals friends society in philadelphia schopenhauer even went so far as to protest against the use of the pronoun it in reference to animals because it led to the treatment of them as though they were inanimate things to reinforce his points schopenhauer referred to anecdotal reports of the look in the eyes of a monkey who had been shot and also the grief of a baby elephant whose mother had been killed by a hunter he was very attached to his succession of pet poodles schopenhauer criticized spinozas belief that animals are to be used as a mere means for the satisfaction of humans views on homosexuality in the third expanded edition of the world as will and representation 1859 schopenhauer added an appendix to his chapter on the metaphysics of sexual love he also wrote that homosexuality did have the benefit of preventing illbegotten children concerning this he stated that the vice we are considering appears to work directly against the aims and ends of nature and that in a matter that is all important and of the greatest concern to her it must in fact serve these very aims although only indirectly as a means for preventing greater evils views on pederasty he wrote that only those who were too old or too young to reproduce strong healthy children would resort to pederasty schopenhauer considered pederasty in itself a vice shrewdly anticipating the interpretive distortion on the part of the popular mind of his attempted scientific explanation of pederasty as personal advocacy when he had otherwise described the act in terms of spiritual ethics as an objectionable aberration schopenhauer sarcastically concludes the appendix with the statement that by expounding these paradoxical ideas i wanted to grant to the professors of philosophy a small favour for they are very disconcerted by the everincreasing publicization of my philosophy which they so carefully concealed i have done so by giving them the opportunity of slandering me by saying that i defend and commend pederasty intellectual interests and affinities indology schopenhauer read the latin translation of the ancient hindu texts the upanishads which french writer anquetil du perron had translated from the persian translation of prince dara shikoh entitled sirreakbar the great secret he was so impressed by their philosophy that he called them the production of the highest human wisdom and believed they contained superhuman concepts the upanishads was a great source of inspiration to schopenhauer writing about them he said it is the most satisfying and elevating reading with the exception of the original text which is possible in the world it has been the solace of my life and will be the solace of my death it is well known that the book oupnekhat upanishad always lay open on his table and he invariably studied it before sleeping at night he called the opening up of sanskrit literature the greatest gift of our century and predicted that the philosophy and knowledge of the upanishads would become the cherished faith of the west schopenhauer was first introduced to the 1802 latin upanishad translation through friedrich majer they met during the winter of 18131814 in weimar at the home of schopenhauers mother according to the biographer safranski majer was a follower of herder and an early indologist schopenhauer did not begin a serious study of the indic texts however until the summer of 1814 sansfranski maintains that between 1815 and 1817 schopenhauer had another important crosspollination with indian thought in dresden this was through his neighbor of two years karl christian friedrich krause krause was then a minor and rather unorthodox philosopher who attempted to mix his own ideas with that of ancient indian wisdom krause had also mastered sanskrit unlike schopenhauer and the two developed a professional relationship it was from krause that schopenhauer learned meditation and received the closest thing to expert advice concerning indian thought most noticeable in the case of schopenhauers work was the significance of the chandogya upanishad whose mahavakya tat tvam asi is mentioned throughout the world as will and representation buddhism schopenhauer noted a correspondence between his doctrines and the four noble truths of buddhism similarities centered on the principles that life involves suffering that suffering is caused by desire taṇhā and that the extinction of desire leads to liberation thus three of the four truths of the buddha correspond to schopenhauers doctrine of the will in buddhism however while greed and lust are always unskillful desire is ethically variable it can be skillful unskillful or neutral for schopenhauer will had ontological primacy over the intellect in other words desire is understood to be prior to thought schopenhauer felt this was similar to notions of puruṣārtha or goals of life in vedānta hinduism in schopenhauers philosophy denial of the will is attained by either personal experience of an extremely great suffering that leads to loss of the will to live or knowledge of the essential nature of life in the world through observation of the suffering of other people however buddhist nirvāṇa is not equivalent to the condition that schopenhauer described as denial of the will nirvāṇa is not the extinguishing of the person as some western scholars have thought but only the extinguishing the literal meaning of nirvana of the flames of greed hatred and delusion that assail a persons character occult historian joscelyn godwin 1945 stated it was buddhism that inspired the philosophy of arthur schopenhauer and through him attracted richard wagner this orientalism reflected the struggle of the german romantics in the words of leon poliakov to free themselves from judeochristian fetters in contradistinction to godwins claim that buddhism inspired schopenhauer the philosopher himself made the following statement in his discussion of religions if i wished to take the results of my philosophy as the standard of truth i should have to concede to buddhism preeminence over the others in any case it must be a pleasure to me to see my doctrine in such close agreement with a religion that the majority of men on earth hold as their own for this numbers far more followers than any other and this agreement must be yet the more pleasing to me inasmuch as in my philosophizing i have certainly not been under its influence emphasis added for up till 1818 when my work appeared there was to be found in europe only a very few accounts of buddhism buddhist philosopher nishitani keiji however sought to distance buddhism from schopenhauer while schopenhauers philosophy may sound rather mystical in such a summary his methodology was resolutely empirical rather than speculative or transcendental philosophy is a science and as such has no articles of faith accordingly in it nothing can be assumed as existing except what is either positively given empirically or demonstrated through indubitable conclusions also note this actual world of what is knowable in which we are and which is in us remains both the material and the limit of our consideration the argument that buddhism affected schopenhauers philosophy more than any other dharmic faith loses

78,early migrations and political units territory comprising kingdom of ndongo presentday angola modern angola was populated predominantly by nomadic khoi and san prior to the first bantu migrations the khoi and san peoples were neither pastoralists nor cultivators following a huntergatherer lifestyle they were displaced by bantu peoples arriving from the north most of whom likely originated in what is today northwestern nigeria and southern niger bantu speakers introduced the cultivation of bananas and taro as well as large cattle herds to angolas central highlands and the luanda plain during this time the bantu established a number of political entities in most of what today comprises angola the best known of these was the kingdom of the kongo which was based in angola but also extended northward to what is now the democratic republic of the congo and the republic of the congo as well as gabon it established trade routes with other citystates and civilisations up and down the coast of southwestern and western africa and even with great zimbabwe and the mutapa empire but engaged in little or no transoceanic trade to its south lay the kingdom of ndongo from which the area of the later portuguese colony was sometimes known as dongo portuguese colonisation queen nzinga in peace negotiations with the portuguese governor in luanda 1657 the region now known as angola was reached by the portuguese explorer diogo cão in 1484 the year before the portuguese had established relations with the kongo which stretched at the time from modern gabon in the north to the kwanza river in the south the portuguese established their primary early trading post at soyo which is now the northernmost city in angola apart from the cabinda exclave paulo dias de novais founded são paulo de loanda luanda in 1575 with a hundred families of settlers and four hundred soldiers benguela was fortified in 1587 and elevated to a township in 1617 the portuguese established several other settlements forts and trading posts along the angolan coast principally trading in angolan slaves for brazilian plantations local slave dealers provided a large number of slaves for the portuguese empire usually sold in exchange for manufactured goods from europe this part of the atlantic slave trade continued until after brazils independence in the 1820s despite portugals territorial claims to angola its control over much of the countrys vast interior was minimal in the 16th century portugal gained control of the coast through a series of treaties and wars life for european colonists was difficult and progress proved to be slow iliffe notes that portuguese records of angola from the 16th century show that a great famine occurred on average every seventy years accompanied by epidemic disease it might kill onethird or onehalf of the population destroying the demographic growth of a generation and forcing colonists back into the river valleys an illustration depicting portuguese encounter with kongo royal family during the portuguese restoration war the dutch west india company occupied the principal settlement of luanda in 1641 using alliances with local peoples to carry out attacks against portuguese holdings elsewhere a fleet under salvador de sá retook luanda in 1648 reconquest of the rest of the territory was completed by 1650 new treaties with the kongo were signed in 1649 others with njingas kingdom of matamba and ndongo followed in 1656 the conquest of pungo andongo in 1671 was the last major portuguese expansion from luanda as attempts to invade kongo in 1670 and matamba in 1681 failed colonial outposts also expanded inward from benguela but until the late 19th century the inroads from luanda and benguela were very limited hamstrung by a series of political upheavals in the early 1800s portugal was slow to mount a large scale annexation of angolan territory the slave trade was abolished in angola in 1836 and in 1854 the colonial government freed all its existing slaves four years later a more progressive administration appointed by lisbon abolished slavery altogether however these decrees remained largely unenforceable and the portuguese were dependent on assistance from the royal navy to enforce their ban on the slave trade this coincided with a series of renewed military expeditions on the hinterland and by the midnineteenth century portugal had established its dominion as far east as the congo river and as far south as mossâmedes until the late 1880s lisbon entertained proposals to link angola with its colony in mozambique but was blocked by british and belgian opposition during this whole period the portuguese came up against different forms of armed resistance from various peoples in angola the berlin conference in 18841885 fixed the colonys borders delineating the boundaries of portuguese claims to angola although many details were resolved afterwards until the 1920s trade between portugal and her african territories also rapidly increased as a result of protective tariffs leading to increased development as well as a wave of new portuguese migrants rise of angolan nationalism portuguese troops on patrol in angola during the angolan war of independence under colonial law black angolans were forbidden from forming political parties or labour unions the first nationalist movements did not take root until after world war ii spearheaded by a largely westernised portuguesespeaking urban class which included many mestiços during the early 1960s they were joined by other associations stemming from ad hoc labour activism in the rural workforce portugals refusal to address increasing angolan demands for selfdetermination provoked an armed conflict which erupted in 1961 with the baixa de cassanje revolt and gradually evolved into a protracted war of independence that persisted for the next twelve years throughout the conflict three militant nationalist movements with their own partisan guerrilla wings emerged from the fighting between the portuguese government and local forces supported to varying degrees by the portuguese communist party the national front for the liberation of angola fnla recruited from bakongo refugees in zaire benefiting from particularly favourable political circumstances in léopoldville and especially from a common border with zaire angolan political exiles were able to build up a power base among a large expatriate community from related families clans and tradition people on both sides of the border spoke mutually intelligible dialects and enjoyed shared ties to the historical kingdom of kongo though as foreigners skilled angolans could not take advantage of mobutu sese sekos state employment programme some found work as middlemen for the absentee owners of various lucrative private ventures the migrants eventually formed the fnla with the intention of making a bid for political power upon their envisaged return to angola a largely ovimbundu guerrilla initiative against the portuguese in central angola from 1966 was spearheaded by jonas savimbi and the national union for the total independence of angola unita it remained handicapped by its geographic remoteness from friendly borders by the ethnic fragmentation of the ovimbundu and the isolation of peasants on european plantations where they had little opportunity to mobilise fnla insurgents being trained in zaire in 1973 against the background of these simultaneous efforts the rising of the marxist popular movement for the liberation of angola mpla in the east and dembos hills north of luanda came to hold special significance formed as a coalition resistance by the angolan communist party the organisations leadership remained predominantly ambundu and courted public sector workers in luanda although both the mpla and its rivals had accepted material assistance from the soviet union or the peoples republic of china the former harboured strong antiimperialist views and was openly critical of the united states and its support for portugal this allowed it to win important ground on the diplomatic front soliciting support from nonaligned governments in morocco ghana guinea mali and the united arab republic the mpla attempted to move its headquarters from conakry to léopoldville in october 1961 renewing efforts to create a common front with the fnla then known as the union of angolan peoples upa and its leader holden roberto roberto turned down the offer when the mpla first attempted to insert its own insurgents into angola the cadres were ambushed and annihilated by upa partisans on robertos orderssetting a precedent for the bitter factional strife which would later ignite the angolan civil war civil war monument to the memory of agostinho neto and angolan independence in luanda throughout the war of independence the three rival nationalist movements were severely hampered by political and military factionalism as well as their inability to unite guerrilla efforts against the portuguese between 1961 and 1975 the mpla unita and the fnla competed for influence in the angolan population and the international community the soviet union and cuba became especially sympathetic towards the mpla and supplied that party with arms ammunition funding and training they also backed unita militants until it became clear that the latter was at irreconcilable odds with the mpla the collapse of portugals estado novo government following the 1974 carnation revolution led to a suspension of all portuguese military activities in africa and the brokering of a ceasefire pending negotiations for angolan independence encouraged by the organisation of african unity holden roberto jonas savimbi and mpla chairman agostinho neto met in mombasa in early january 1975 and agreed to form a coalition government this was ratified by the alvor agreement later that month which called for general elections and set the countrys independence date for 11 november 1975 all three factions however followed up on the ceasefire by taking advantage of the gradual portuguese withdrawal to seize various strategic positions acquire more arms and enlarge their militant forces the rapid influx of weapons from numerous external sources especially the soviet union and the united states as well as the escalation of tensions between the nationalist parties fueled a new outbreak of hostilities with tacit american and zairean support the fnla began massing large numbers of troops in northern angola in an attempt to gain military superiority meanwhile the mpla began securing control of luanda a traditional ambundu stronghold sporadic violence broke out in luanda over the next few months after the fnla attacked mpla forces in march 1975 the fighting intensified with street clashes in april and may and unita became involved after over two hundred of its members were massacred by an mpla contingent that june an upswing in soviet arms shipments to the mpla influenced a decision by the central intelligence agency to likewise provide substantial covert aid to the fnla and unita in august 1975 the mpla requested direct assistance from the soviet union in the form of ground troops the soviets declined offering to send advisers but no troops however cuba was more forthcoming and in late september dispatched nearly five hundred combat personnel to angola along with sophisticated weaponry and supplies by independence there were over a thousand cuban soldiers in the country they were kept supplied by a massive airbridge carried out with soviet aircraft the persistent buildup of cuban and soviet military aid allowed the mpla to drive its opponents from luanda and blunt an abortive intervention by zairean and south african troops which had deployed in a belated attempt to assist the fnla and unita the fnla was largely annihilated although unita managed to withdraw its civil officials and militia from luanda and seek sanctuary in the southern provinces from there savimbi continued to mount a determined insurgent campaign against the mpla an mpla staff car burns after being destroyed in the fighting outside novo redondo present day sumbe in late 1975 between 1975 and 1991 the mpla implemented an economic and political system based on the principles of scientific socialism incorporating central planning and a marxistleninist oneparty state it embarked on an ambitious programme of nationalisation and made a concerted attempt to eliminate the preexisting private sector all locally owned enterprises in every sector of economic activity were subject to nationalisation by the state these were then incorporated into a single umbrella of stateowned enterprises known as unidades economicas estatais uee under the mpla angola experienced a significant degree of modern industrialisation however corruption and graft also increased as public resources were either allocated inefficiently or simply embezzled by officials for personal enrichment the ruling party survived an attempted coup détat by the maoistoriented communist organisation of angola oca in 1977 which was suppressed after a series of bloody political purges that left thousands of oca supporters dead the mpla abandoned its former marxist ideology at its third party congress in 1990 and declared social democracy to be its new platform angola subsequently became a member of the international monetary fund restrictions on the market economy were also reduced in an attempt to draw foreign investment by may 1991 it had reached a peace agreement with unita the bicesse accords which scheduled new general elections for september 1992 when the mpla secured a major electoral victory unita objected to the results of both the presidential and legislative vote count and returned to war ceasefire with unita on 22 march 2002 jonas savimbi was killed in action against government troops unita and the mpla reached a ceasefire shortly afterwards unita gave up its armed wing and assumed the role of a major opposition party although the political situation of the country began to stabilise regular democratic processes did not prevail until the elections in angola in 2008 and 2012 and the adoption of a new constitution in 2010 all of which strengthened the prevailing dominantparty system angola has a serious humanitarian crisis the result of the prolonged war of the abundance of minefields of the continued political and to a much lesser degree military activities in favour of the independence of the exclave of cabinda carried out in the context of the protracted cabinda conflict by the frente para a libertação do enclave de cabinda flec but most of all by the depredation of the countrys rich mineral resources by the régime while most of the internally displaced have now settled around the capital in the socalled musseques the general situation for angolans remains desperate drought in 2016 caused the worst food crisis in southern africa in 25 years drought affected 14 million people across seven of angolas 18 provinces food prices rose and acute malnutrition rates doubled with more than 95000 children affected food insecurity was expected to worsen from july to december 2016

oil and diamonds have been the most important economic resource smallholder and plantation agriculture have dramatically dropped because of the angolan civil war but have begun to recover after 2002 the transformation industry that had come into existence in the late colonial period collapsed at independence because of the exodus of most of the ethnic portuguese population but has begun to reemerge with updated technologies partly because of the influx of new portuguese entrepreneurs similar developments can be verified in the service sector overall angolas economy has in recent years moved on from the disarray caused by a quartercentury of civil war to become the fastestgrowing economy in africa and one of the fastest in the world with an average gdp growth of 20 percent between 2005 and 2007 in the period 200110 angola had the worlds highest annual average gdp growth at 111 percent in 2004 the exim bank of china approved a 2 billion line of credit to angola the loan was to

mechanical and electrical products machinery parts and construction materials surged 388 the oil glut led to a local unleaded gasoline pricetag of 037 per gallon the economist reported in 2008 that diamonds and oil make up 60 of angolas economy almost all of the countrys revenue and are its dominant exports growth is almost entirely driven by rising oil production which surpassed in late 2005

and 176 in 2007 however due to the global recession the economy contracted an estimated 03 in 2009 the security brought about by the 2002 peace settlement has led to the resettlement of 4 million displaced persons thus resulting in largescale increases in agriculture production although the countrys economy has developed significantly since it achieved political stability in 2002 mainly thanks to the fastrising earnings of the oil sector angola faces huge social and economic problems these are in part a result of the almost continual state of conflict from 1961 onwards although the highest level of destruction and socioeconomic damage took place after the 1975 independence during the long years of civil war however high poverty rates and blatant social inequality are chiefly the outcome of a combination of a persistent political authoritarianism of neopatrimonial practices at all levels of the political administrative armed forces and economic apparatuses and of a pervasive corruption the main beneficiary of this situation is a social segment constituted during the last decades around the political administrative economic and military power holders which has accumulated and continues accumulating enormous wealth secondary beneficiaries are the middle strata which are about to become social classes however overall almost half the population has to be considered as poor but in this respect there are dramatic differences between the countryside and the cities where by now slightly more than 50 of the people live an inquiry carried out in 2008 by the angolan

billion from china exim bank one in 2004 the second in 2007 as well as one loan in 2005 of 29 billion from china international fund ltd growing oil revenues have also created opportunities for corruption according to a recent human rights watch report 32 billion us dollars disappeared from government accounts from 2007 to 2010 furthermore sonangol the state run oil company has control of 51 of cabindas oil due to this market control the company ends up determining the profit given to the government and the taxes paid the council of foreign affairs states that the world bank mentioned that sonangol is a taxpayer it carries out quasifiscal activities it invests public funds and as concessionaire it is a sector regulator this multifarious work programme creates conflicts of interest and characterises a complex relationship between sonangol and the government that weakens the formal budgetary process and creates uncertainty as regards the actual fiscal stance of the state before independence in 1975 angola was a breadbasket of southern africa and a major exporter of bananas coffee and sisal but three decades of civil war 19752002 destroyed fertile countryside left it littered with landmines and drove millions into the cities the country now depends on expensive food imports mainly from south africa and portugal while more than 90 of farming is done at the family and subsistence level thousands of angolan smallscale farmers are trapped in poverty the enormous differences between the regions pose a serious structural problem for the angolan economy illustrated by the fact that about one third of economic activities are concentrated in luanda and neighbouring bengo province while several areas of the interior suffer economic stagnation and even regression one of the economic consequences of the social and regional disparities is a sharp increase in angolan private investments abroad the small fringe of angolan society where most of the accumulation takes place seeks to spread its assets for reasons of security and profit for the time being the biggest share of these investments is concentrated in portugal where the angolan presence including that of the family of the state president in banks as well as in the domains of energy telecommunications and mass media has become notable as has the acquisition of vineyards and orchards as well as of touristic enterprises subsaharan africa nations are globally achieving impressive improvements in wellbeing according to a report by tony blair africa governance initiative and the boston consulting

85,albert s johnston in confederate army uniform wearing three gold stars and wreath on a generals collar at the outbreak of the american civil war johnston was the commander of the us army department of the pacific in california like many regular army officers from the south he was opposed to secession but he resigned his commission soon after he heard of the secession of his adopted state of texas it was accepted by the war department on may 6 1861 effective may 3 on april 28 he moved to los angeles the home of his wifes brother john griffin considering staying in california with his wife and five children johnston remained there until may soon under suspicion by local union officials he evaded arrest and joined the los angeles mounted rifles as a private leaving warners ranch may 27 he participated in their trek across the southwestern deserts to texas crossing the colorado river into the confederate territory of arizona on july 4 1861 early in the civil war confederate president jefferson davis decided that the confederacy would attempt to hold as much of its territory as possible and therefore distributed military forces around its borders and coasts in the summer of 1861 davis appointed several generals to defend confederate lines from the mississippi river east to the allegheny mountains the most sensitive and in many ways the most crucial areas along the mississippi river and in western tennessee along the tennessee and the cumberland rivers were placed under the command of maj gen leonidas polk and brig gen gideon j pillow the latter had initially been in command in tennessee as that states top general their impolitic occupation of columbus kentucky on september 3 1861 two days before johnston arrived in the confederacys capital of richmond virginia after his crosscountry journey drove kentucky from its stated neutrality the majority of kentuckians allied with the union camp polk and pillows action gave union brig gen ulysses s grant an excuse to take control of the strategically located town of paducah kentucky without raising the ire of most kentuckians and the prounion majority in the state legislature confederate command in western theater on september 10 1861 johnston was assigned to command the huge area of the confederacy west of the allegheny mountains except for coastal areas he became commander of the confederacys western armies in the area often called the western department or western military department johnstons appointment as a full general by his friend and admirer jefferson davis already had been confirmed by the confederate senate on august 31 1861 the appointment had been backdated to rank from may 30 1861 making him the second highest ranking general in the confederate states army only adjutant general and inspector general samuel cooper ranked ahead of him after his appointment johnston immediately headed for his new territory he was permitted to call on governors of arkansas tennessee and mississippi for new troops although this authority was largely stifled by politics especially with respect to mississippi on september 13 1861 johnston ordered brig gen felix zollicoffer with 4000 men to occupy cumberland gap in kentucky in order to block union troops from coming into eastern tennessee the kentucky legislature had voted to side with the union after the occupation of columbus by polk by september 18 johnston had brig gen simon bolivar buckner with another 4000 men blocking the railroad route to tennessee at bowling green kentucky johnston had fewer than 40000 men spread throughout kentucky tennessee arkansas and missouri of these 10000 were in missouri under missouri state guard maj gen sterling price johnston did not quickly gain many recruits when he first requested them from the governors but his more serious problem was lacking sufficient arms and ammunition for the troops he already had as the confederate government concentrated efforts on the units in the east they gave johnston small numbers of reinforcements and minimal amounts of arms and material johnston maintained his defense by conducting raids and other measures to make it appear he had larger forces than he did a strategy that worked for several months johnstons tactics had so annoyed and confused union brig gen william tecumseh sherman in kentucky that he became paranoid and mentally unstable sherman overestimated johnstons forces and had to be relieved by brig gen don carlos buell on november 9 1861 battle of mill springs eastern tennessee was held for the confederacy by two unimpressive brigadier generals appointed by jefferson davis felix zollicoffer a brave but untrained and inexperienced officer and soontobe maj gen george b crittenden a former us army officer with apparent alcohol problems while crittenden was away in richmond zollicoffer moved his forces to the north bank of the upper cumberland river near mill springs now nancy kentucky putting the river to his back and his forces into a trap zollicoffer decided it was impossible to obey orders to return to the other side of the river because of scarcity of transport and proximity of union troops when union brig gen george h thomas moved against the confederates crittenden decided to attack one of the two parts of thomass command at logans cross roads near mill springs before the union forces could unite at the battle of mill springs on january 19 1862 the illprepared confederates after a night march in the rain attacked the union force with some initial success as the battle progressed zollicoffer was killed crittenden was unable to lead the confederate force he may have been intoxicated and the confederates were turned back and routed by a union bayonet charge suffering 533 casualties from their force of 4000 the confederate troops who escaped were assigned to other units as general crittenden faced an investigation of his conduct after the confederate defeat at the mill springs davis sent johnston a brigade and a few other scattered reinforcements he also assigned him gen p g t beauregard who was supposed to attract recruits because of his victories early in the war and act as a competent subordinate for johnston the brigade was led by brig gen john b floyd considered incompetent he took command at fort donelson as the senior general present just before union brig gen ulysses s grant attacked the fort historians believe the assignment of beauregard to the west stimulated union commanders to attack the forts before beauregard could make a difference in the theater union officers heard that he was bringing 15 regiments with him but this was an exaggeration of his forces fort henry fort donelson nashville based on the assumption that kentucky neutrality would act as a shield against a direct invasion from the north tennessee initially had sent men to virginia and concentrated defenses in the mississippi valley circumstances that no longer applied in september 1861 even before johnston arrived in tennessee construction of two forts had been started to defend the tennessee and the cumberland rivers which provided avenues into the state from the north both forts were located in tennessee in order to respect kentucky neutrality but these were not in ideal locations fort henry on the tennessee river was in an unfavorable lowlying location commanded by hills on the kentucky side of the river fort donelson on the cumberland river although in a better location had a vulnerable land side and did not have enough heavy artillery to defend against gunboats maj gen polk ignored the problems of the forts when he took command after johnston took command polk at first refused to comply with johnstons order to send an engineer lt joseph k dixon to inspect the forts after johnston asserted his authority polk had to allow dixon to proceed dixon recommended that the forts be maintained and strengthened although they were not in ideal locations because much work had been done on them and the confederates might not have time to build new ones johnston accepted his recommendations johnston wanted major alexander p stewart to command the forts but president davis appointed brig gen lloyd tilghman as commander to prevent polk from dissipating his forces by allowing some men to join a partisan group johnston ordered him to send brig gen gideon pillow and 5000 men to fort donelson pillow took up a position at nearby clarksville tennessee and did not move into the fort until february 7 1862 alerted by a union reconnaissance on january 14 1862 johnston ordered tilghman to fortify the high ground opposite fort henry which polk had failed to do despite johnstons orders tilghman failed to act decisively on these orders which in any event were too late to be adequately carried out gen beauregard arrived at johnstons headquarters at bowling green on february 4 1862 and was given overall command of polks force at the western end of johnstons line at columbus kentucky on february 6 1862 union navy gunboats quickly reduced the defenses of illsited fort henry inflicting 21 casualties on the small remaining confederate force brig gen lloyd tilghman surrendered the 94 remaining officers and men of his approximately 3000man force which had not been sent to fort donelson before us grants force could even take up their positions johnston knew he could be trapped at bowling green if fort donelson fell so he moved his force to nashville the capital of tennessee and an increasingly important confederate industrial center beginning on february 11 1862 johnston also reinforced fort donelson with 12000 more men including those under floyd and pillow a curious decision in view of his thought that the union gunboats alone might be able to take the fort he did order the commanders of the fort to evacuate the troops if the fort could not be held the senior generals sent to the fort to command the enlarged garrison gideon j pillow and john b floyd squandered their chance to avoid having to surrender most of the garrison and on february 16 1862 brig gen simon buckner having been abandoned by floyd and pillow surrendered fort donelson colonel nathan bedford forrest escaped with his cavalry force of about 700 men before the surrender the confederates suffered about 1500 casualties with an estimated 12000 to 14000 taken prisoner union casualties were 500 killed 2108 wounded 224 missing johnston who had little choice in allowing floyd and pillow to take charge at fort donelson on the basis of seniority after he ordered them to add their forces to the garrison took the blame and suffered calls for his removal because a full explanation to the press and public would have exposed the weakness of the confederate position his passive defensive performance while positioning himself in a forward position at bowling green spreading his forces too thinly not concentrating his forces in the face of union advances and appointing or relying upon inadequate or incompetent subordinates subjected him to criticism at the time and by later historians the fall of the forts exposed nashville to imminent attack and it fell without resistance to union forces under brig gen buell on february 25 1862 two days after johnston had to pull his forces out in order to avoid having them captured as well concentration at corinth johnston had various remaining military units scattered throughout his territory and retreating to the south to avoid being cut off johnston himself retreated with the force under his personal command the army of central kentucky from the vicinity of nashville with beauregards help johnston decided to concentrate forces with those formerly under polk and now already under beauregards command at the strategically located railroad crossroads of corinth mississippi which he reached by a circuitous route johnston kept the union forces now under the overall command of the ponderous maj gen henry halleck confused and hesitant to move allowing johnston to reach his objective undetected this delay allowed jefferson davis finally to send reinforcements from the garrisons of coastal cities and another highly rated but prickly general braxton bragg to help organize the western forces bragg at least calmed the nerves of beauregard and polk who had become agitated by their apparent dire situation in the face of numerically superior forces before the arrival of johnston on march 24 1862 johnstons army of 17000 men gave the confederates a combined force of about 40000 to 44669 men at corinth on march 29 1862 johnston officially took command of this combined force which continued to use the army of the mississippi name under which it had been organized by beauregard on march 5 johnston now planned to defeat the union forces piecemeal before the various union units in kentucky and tennessee under grant with 40000 men at nearby pittsburg landing tennessee and the now maj gen don carlos buell on his way from nashville with 35000 men could unite against him johnston started his army in motion on april 3 1862 intent on surprising grants force as soon as the next day but they moved slowly due to their inexperience bad roads and lack of adequate staff planning due to the delays as well as several contacts with the enemy johnstons second in command p g t beauregard felt the element of surprise had been lost and recommended calling off the attack johnston decided to proceed as planned stating i would fight them if they were a million his army was finally in position within a mile or two of grants force and undetected by the evening of april 5 1862 battle of shiloh and death monument to johnston at shiloh national military park johnston launched a massive surprise attack with his concentrated forces against grant at the battle of shiloh on april 6 1862 as the confederate forces overran the union camps johnston seemed to be everywhere personally leading and rallying troops up and down the line on his horse at about 230 pm while leading one of those charges against a union camp near the peach orchard he was wounded taking a bullet behind his right knee he apparently did not think the wound was serious at the time or even possibly did not feel it it is possible that johnstons duel in 1837 had caused nerve damage or numbness to his right leg and that he did not feel the wound to his leg as a result the bullet had in fact clipped a part of his popliteal artery and his boot was filling up with blood there were no medical personnel on scene at the time since johnston had sent his personal surgeon to care for the wounded confederate troops and yankee prisoners earlier in the battle within a few minutes johnston was observed by his staff to be nearly fainting among his staff was isham g harris the governor of tennessee who had ceased to make any real effort to function as governor after learning that abraham lincoln had appointed andrew johnson as military governor of tennessee seeing johnston slumping in his saddle and his face turning deathly pale harris asked general are you wounded johnston glanced down at his leg wound then faced harris and replied in a weak voice his last words yes and i fear seriously harris and other staff officers removed johnston from his horse and carried him to a small ravine near the hornets nest and desperately tried to aid the general who had lost consciousness by this point harris then sent an aide to fetch johnstons surgeon but did not apply a tourniquet to johnsons wounded leg before a doctor could be found johnston died from blood loss a few minutes later it is believed that johnston may have lived for as long as one hour after receiving his fatal wound ironically it was later discovered that johnston had a tourniquet in his pocket when he died harris and the other officers wrapped general johnstons body in a blanket so as not to damage the troops morale with the sight of the dead general johnston and his wounded horse named fire eater were taken to his field headquarters on the corinth road where his body remained in his tent until the confederate army withdrew to corinth the next day april 7 1862 after failing to gain a decisive victory over the union armies from there his body was taken to the home of colonel william inge which had been his headquarters in corinth it was covered in the confederate flag and lay in state for several hours it is probable that a confederate soldier fired the fatal round no union soldiers were observed to have ever gotten behind johnston during the fatal charge while it is known that many confederates were firing at the union lines while johnston charged well in advance of his soldiers furthermore the surgeon who later dug the bullet out of johnstons leg identified the round as one fired from a pattern 1853 enfield no union troops in the area where johnston was hit had been issued enfield rifles whereas the enfield rifle was standard issue for the confederate forces johnston was leading johnston was the highestranking fatality of the war on either side and his death was a strong blow to the morale of the confederacy at the time jefferson davis considered him the best general in the country

86,several projects aiming to create androids that look and to a certain degree speak or act like a human being have been launched or are underway japan der 01 a japanese actroid japanese robotics have been leading the field since the 1970s waseda university initiated the wabot project in 1967 and in 1972 completed the wabot1 the first android a fullscale humanoid intelligent robot its limb control system allowed it to walk with the lower limbs and to grip and transport objects with hands using tactile sensors its vision system allowed it to measure distances and directions to objects using external receptors artificial eyes and ears and its conversation system allowed it to communicate with a person in japanese with an artificial mouth in 1984 wabot2 was revealed and made a number of improvements it was capable of playing the organ wabot2 had 10 fingers and two feet and was able to read a score of music it was also able to accompany a person in 1986 honda began its humanoid research and development program to create humanoid robots capable of interacting successfully with humans the intelligent robotics lab directed by hiroshi ishiguro at osaka university and kokoro co ltd have demonstrated the actroid at expo 2005 in aichi prefecture japan and released the telenoid r1 in 2010 in 2006 kokoro co developed a new der 2 android the height of the human body part of der2 is 165 cm there are 47 mobile points der2 can not only change its expression but also move its hands and feet and twist its body the air servosystem which kokoro co developed originally is used for the actuator as a result of having an actuator controlled precisely with air pressure via a servosystem the movement is very fluid and there is very little noise der2 realized a slimmer body than that of the former version by using a smaller cylinder outwardly der2 has a more beautiful proportion compared to the previous model der2 has thinner arms and a wider repertoire of expressions once programmed it is able to choreograph its motions and gestures with its voice the intelligent mechatronics lab directed by hiroshi kobayashi at the tokyo university of science has developed an android head called saya which was exhibited at robodex 2002 in yokohama japan there are several other initiatives around the world involving humanoid research and development at this time which will hopefully introduce a broader spectrum of realized technology in the near future now saya is working at the science university of tokyo as a guide the waseda university japan and ntt docomos manufacturers have succeeded in creating a shapeshifting robot wd2 it is capable of changing its face at first the creators decided the positions of the necessary points to express the outline eyes nose and so on of a certain person the robot expresses its face by moving all points to the decided positions they say the first version of the robot was first developed back in 2003 after that a year later they made a couple of major improvements to the design the robot features an elastic mask made from the average head dummy it uses a driving system with a 3dof unit the wd2 robot can change its facial features by activating specific facial points on a mask with each point possessing three degrees of freedom this one has 17 facial points for a total of 56 degrees of freedom as for the materials they used the wd2s mask is fabricated with a highly elastic material called septom with bits of steel wool mixed in for added strength other technical features reveal a shaft driven behind the mask at the desired facial point driven by a dc motor with a simple pulley and a slide screw apparently the researchers can also modify the shape of the mask based on actual human faces to copy a face they need only a 3d scanner to determine the locations of an individuals 17 facial points after that they are then driven into position using a laptop and 56 motor control boards in addition the researchers also mention that the shifting robot can even display an individuals hair style and skin color if a photo of their face is projected onto the 3d mask singapore prof nadia thalmann a

86,the word was coined from the greek root ἀνδρ man male as opposed to anthrop human being and the suffix oid having the form or likeness of while the term android is used in reference to humanlooking robots in general a robot with a female appearance can also be referred to as a gynoid the oxford english dictionary traces the earliest use as androides to ephraim chambers cyclopaedia in reference to an automaton that st albertus magnus allegedly created the term android appears in us patents as early as 1863 in reference to miniature humanlike toy automatons the term android was used in a more modern sense by the french author auguste villiers de lisleadam in his work tomorrows eve 1886 this story features an artificial humanlike robot named hadaly as said by the officer in the story in this age of realien advancement who knows what goes on in the mind of those responsible for these mechanical dolls the term made an impact into english pulp science fiction starting from jack williamsons the cometeers 1936 and the distinction between mechanical robots and fleshy androids was popularized by edmond hamiltons captain future 19401944 although karel čapeks robots in rur rossums universal robots 1921the play that introduced the word robot to the worldwere organic artificial humans the word robot has come to primarily refer to mechanical humans animals and other beings the term android can mean either one of these while a cyborg cybernetic organism or bionic man would be a creature that is a combination of organic and mechanical parts the term droid popularized by george lucas in the original star wars film and now used widely within science fiction originated as an abridgment of android but has been used by lucas and others to mean any robot including distinctly nonhuman form machines like r2d2 the word android was used in star trek the original series episode what are little girls made of the abbreviation andy coined as a pejorative by writer philip k dick in his novel do androids dream of electric sheep has seen some further usage such as within the tv series total recall 2070 authors have used the term android in more diverse ways than robot or cyborg in some fictional works the difference between a robot and android is only their appearance with androids being made to look like humans on the outside but with robotlike internal mechanics in other stories authors have used the word android to mean a wholly organic yet artificial creation other fictional depictions of androids fall somewhere in between eric g wilson who defines androids as a synthetic human being distinguishes between three types of androids based on their bodys composition the mummy type where androids are made of dead things or stiff inanimate natural material such as mummies puppets dolls and statues the golem type androids made from flexible possibly organic material including golems and homunculi the automaton type androids which are a mix of dead and living parts including automatons and robots although human morphology is not necessarily the ideal form for working robots the fascination in developing robots that can mimic it can be found historically in the assimilation of two concepts simulacra devices that exhibit likeness and automata devices that have independence
86,an android is a humanoid robot or synthetic organism designed to look and act like a human especially one with a body having a fleshlike resemblance historically androids remained completely within the domain of science fiction where they are frequently seen in film and television only recently have advancements in robot technology allowed the design of functional and realistic humanoid robots
86,androids are a staple of science fiction isaac asimov pioneered the fictionalization of the science of robotics and artificial intelligence notably in his 1950s series i robot one thing common to most fictional androids is that the reallife technological challenges associated with creating thoroughly humanlike robotssuch as the creation of strong artificial intelligenceare assumed to have been solved fictional androids are often depicted as mentally and physically equal or superior to humansmoving thinking and speaking as fluidly as them the tension between the nonhuman substance and the human appearanceor even human ambitionsof androids is the dramatic impetus behind most of their fictional depictions some android heroes seek like pinocchio to become human as in the films bicentennial man hollywood enthiran and ai artificial intelligence or data in star trek the next generation others as in the film westworld rebel against abuse by careless humans android hunter deckard in do androids dream of electric sheep and its film adaptation blade runner discovers that his targets are in some ways more human than he is android stories therefore are not essentially stories about androids they are stories about the human condition and what it means to be human one aspect of writing about the meaning of humanity is to use discrimination against androids as a mechanism for exploring racism in society as in blade runner perhaps the clearest example of this is john brunners 1968 novel into the slave nebula where the blueskinned android slaves are explicitly shown to be fully human more recently the androids bishop and annalee call in the films aliens and alien resurrection are used as vehicles for exploring how humans deal with the presence of an other female androids or gynoids are often seen in science fiction and can be viewed as a continuation of the long tradition of men attempting to create the stereotypical perfect woman examples include the greek myth of pygmalion and the female robot maria in fritz langs metropolis some gynoids like pris in blade runner are designed as sexobjects with the intent of pleasing mens violent sexual desires or as submissive servile companions such as in the stepford wives fiction about gynoids has therefore been described as reinforcing essentialist ideas of femininity although others have suggested that the treatment of androids is a way of exploring racism and misogyny in society the 2015 japanese film sayonara starring geminoid f was promoted as the first movie to feature an android performing opposite a human actor in the 2009 film surrogates people to purchase remotecontrolled humanoid robots through which they interact with society

located in central and northcentral alberta in both red deer and edmonton polyethylene and vinyl manufacturers produce products that are shipped all over the world edmontons oil refineries provide the raw materials for a large petrochemical industry to the east of edmonton the athabasca oil sands surrounding fort mcmurray have estimated unconventional oil reserves approximately equal to the conventional oil reserves of the rest of the world estimated to be 16 trillion barrels 254 km3 many companies employ both conventional strip mining and nonconventional in situ methods to extract the bitumen from the oil sands as of late 2006 there were over 100 billion in oil sands projects under construction or in the planning stages in northeastern alberta another factor determining the viability of oil extraction from the oil sands is the price of oil the oil price increases since 2003 have made it profitable to extract this oil which in the past would give little profit or even a loss by mid2014 however rising costs and stabilizing oil prices were threatening the economic viability of some projects an example of this was the shelving of the joslyn north project in the

farming often with fallow seasons interspersed with cultivation continuous cropping in which there is no fallow season is gradually becoming a more common mode of production because of increased profits and a reduction of soil erosion across the province the once common grain elevator is slowly being lost as rail lines are decreasing farmers typically truck the grain to central points alberta is the leading beekeeping province of canada with some beekeepers wintering hives indoors in specially designed barns in southern alberta then migrating north during the summer into the peace river

it from the us state of montana while on the north the 60th parallel north divides it from the northwest territories to the east the 110th meridian west separates it from the province of saskatchewan while on the west its boundary with british columbia follows the 120th meridian west south from the northwest territories at 60n until it reaches the continental divide at the rocky mountains and from that point follows the line of peaks marking the continental divide in a generally southeasterly direction until it reaches the montana border at 49n the province extends north to south and east to west at its maximum width its highest point is at the summit of mount columbia in the rocky mountains along the southwest border while its lowest point is on the slave river in wood buffalo national

in northern canada the region with its proximity to canadas largest oil fields has most of western canadas oil refinery capacity calgary is located approximately south of edmonton and north of montana surrounded by extensive ranching country almost 75 of the provinces population lives in the calgaryedmonton corridor the land grant policy to the railroads served as a means to populate the province in its early years most of the northern half of the province is boreal forest while the rocky mountains along the southwestern boundary are largely forested see alberta mountain forests and albertabritish columbia foothills forests the southern quarter of the province is prairie ranging from shortgrass prairie in the southeastern corner to mixed grass prairie in an arc to the west and north of it the central aspen parkland region extending in a broad arc between the prairies and the forests from calgary north to edmonton and then east to lloydminster contains the most fertile soil in the province and most of the population much of the unforested part of alberta is given over either to grain or to dairy farming with mixed farming more common in the north and centre while

climate banff trail station in calgary alberta has a humid continental climate with warm summers and cold winters the province is open to cold arctic weather systems from the north which often produce extremely cold conditions in winter as the fronts between the air masses shift north and south across alberta the temperature can change rapidly arctic air masses in the winter produce extreme minimum temperatures varying from in northern alberta to in southern alberta although temperatures at these extremes are rare in the summer continental air masses have produced record maximum temperatures from in the mountains to over in southeastern alberta prairie in alberta alberta extends for over from north to south its climate therefore varies considerably average high temperatures in january range from in the southwest to in the far north the climate is also influenced by the presence of the rocky mountains to the southwest which disrupt the flow of the prevailing westerly winds and cause them to drop most of their moisture on the western slopes of the mountain ranges before reaching the province casting a rain shadow over much of alberta the northerly location and isolation from the weather systems of the pacific ocean cause alberta to have a dry climate with little moderation from the ocean annual precipitation ranges from in the southeast to in the north except in the foothills of the rocky mountains where total precipitation including snowfall can reach annually the province is the namesake of the alberta clipper a type of intense fastmoving winter storm that generally forms over or near the province and pushed with great speed by the continental polar jetstream descends over the rest of southern canada and the northern tier of the united states satellite image of wildfires in alberta in the summer the average daytime temperatures range from around in the rocky mountain valleys and far north up to around in the dry prairie of the southeast the northern and western parts of the province experience higher rainfall and lower evaporation rates caused by cooler summer temperatures the south and eastcentral portions are prone to droughtlike conditions

christmas while edmonton has an 86 chance northern alberta is mostly covered by boreal forest and has a subarctic climate the agricultural area of southern alberta has a semiarid steppe climate because the annual precipitation is less than the water that evaporates or is used by plants the southeastern corner of alberta part of the palliser triangle experiences greater summer heat and lower rainfall than the rest of the province and as a result suffers frequent crop yield problems and occasional severe droughts western alberta is protected by the mountains and enjoys the mild

comprise the judith river group and are the most thoroughly studied dinosaurbearing strata in alberta dinosaurbearing strata are distributed widely throughout alberta the dinosaur provincial park area contains outcrops of the dinosaur park formation and oldman formation in the central and southern regions of alberta are intermittent scollard formation outcrops in the drumheller valley and edmonton regions there are exposed horseshoe canyon facies other formations have been recorded as well like the milk river and foremost formations however these latter two have a lower diversity of documented dinosaurs primarily due to their lower total fossil quantity and neglect from collectors who are hindered by the isolation and scarcity of exposed outcrops their dinosaur fossils are primarily teeth recovered from microvertebrate fossil sites additional geologic formations that have produced only few fossils are the belly river group and st mary river formations of the southwest and the northwestern wapiti formation the wapiti formation contains two pachyrhinosaurus bone beds that break its general trend of low productivity however the bearpaw formation represents strata deposited during a marine transgression dinosaurs are known from this formation but represent specimens washed out to sea or reworked from older sediments

89,actinopterygii or the rayfinned fishes constitute a class or subclass of the bony fishes the rayfinned fishes are so called because their fins are webs of skin supported by bony or horny spines rays as opposed to the fleshy lobed fins that characterize the class sarcopterygii lobefinned fish these actinopterygian fin rays attach directly to the proximal or basal skeletal elements the radials which represent the link or connection between these fins and the internal skeleton eg pelvic and pectoral girdles numerically actinopterygians are the dominant class of vertebrates comprising nearly 99 of the over 30000 species of fish they are ubiquitous throughout freshwater and marine environments from the deep sea to the highest mountain streams extant species can range in size from paedocypris at to the massive ocean sunfish at and the longbodied oarfish at

89,actinopterygians are divided into the subclasses chondrostei and neopterygii the neopterygii in turn are divided into the infraclasses holostei and teleostei during the mesozoic and cenozoic the teleosts in particular diversified widely and as a result 96 of all known fish species are teleosts the cladogram shows the major groups of actinopterygians and their relationship to the terrestrial vertebrates tetrapods that evolved from a related group of fish approximate dates are from near et al 2012 the polypterids bichirs and ropefish are the sister lineage of all other actinopterygians the acipenseriformes sturgeons and paddlefishes are the sister lineage of neopterygii and holostei bowfin and gars are the sister lineage of teleosts the elopomorpha eels and tarpons appears to be the most basic teleosts chondrostei 140pxatlantic sturgeon chondrostei cartilage bone are primarily cartilaginous fish showing some ossification there are 52 species divided among two orders the acipenseriformes sturgeons and paddlefishes and the polypteriformes reedfishes and bichirs it is thought that the chondrosteans evolved from bony fish but lost the bony hardening of their cartilaginous skeletons resulting in a lightening of the frame elderly chondrosteans show beginnings of ossification of the skeleton suggesting that this process is delayed rather than lost in these fish this group has at times been classified with the sharks the similarities are obvious as not only do the chondrosteans mostly lack bone but the structure of the jaw is more akin to that of sharks than other bony fish and both lack scales excluding the polypteriforms additional shared features include spiracles and in sturgeons a heterocercal tail the vertebrae extend into the larger lobe of the caudal fin however the fossil record suggests that these fish have more in common with the teleostei than their external appearance might suggest chondrostei is paraphyletic meaning that this subclass does not contain all the descendants of their common ancestor reclassification of the chondrostei is therefore not out of the question neopterygii 140pxatlantic salmon neopterygii new fins appeared somewhere in the late permian before the time of the dinosaurs there are only few changes during their evolution from the earlier actinopterygians they are a very successful group of fishes because they can move more rapidly than their ancestors their scales and skeletons began to lighten during their evolution and their jaws became more powerful and efficient while electroreception and the ampullae of lorenzini is present in all other groups of fish with the exception of hagfish neopterygii has lost this sense though it later reevolved within gymnotiformes and catfishes who possess

90,albert einstein 14 march 1879 18 april 1955 was a germanborn theoretical physicist einstein developed the theory of relativity one of the two pillars of modern physics alongside quantum mechanics einsteins work is also known for its influence on the philosophy of science einstein is best known by the general public for his massenergy equivalence formula which has been dubbed the worlds most famous equation he received the 1921 nobel prize in physics for his services to theoretical physics and especially for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect a pivotal step in the evolution of quantum theory near the beginning of his career einstein thought that newtonian mechanics was no longer enough to reconcile the laws of classical mechanics with the laws of the electromagnetic field this led him to develop his special theory of relativity during his time at the swiss patent office in bern 19021909 switzerland however he realized that the principle of relativity could also be extended to gravitational fields andwith his subsequent theory of gravitation in 1916he published a paper on general relativity he continued to deal with problems of statistical mechanics and quantum theory which led to his explanations of particle theory and the motion of molecules he also investigated the thermal properties of light which laid the foundation of the photon theory of light in 1917 einstein applied the general theory of relativity to model the largescale structure of the universe between 1895 and 1914 he lived in switzerland except for one year in prague 191112 where he received his academic diploma from the swiss federal polytechnic in zürich later the eidgenössische technische hochschule eth in 1900 he later taught there at the same institute as a professor of theoretical physics between 1912 and 1914 before he left for berlin in 1901 after being stateless for more than five years einstein acquired swiss citizenship which he kept for the rest of his life in 1905 einstein was awarded a phd by the university of zürich the same year his annus mirabilis miracle year he published four groundbreaking papers which were to bring him to the notice of the academic world at the age of 26 he was visiting the united states when adolf hitler came to power in 1933 andbeing jewishdid not go back to germany where he had been a professor at the berlin academy of sciences he settled in the united states becoming an american citizen in 1940 on the eve of world war ii he endorsed a letter to president franklin d roosevelt alerting him to the potential development of extremely powerful bombs of a new type and recommending that the us begin similar research this eventually led to what would become the manhattan project einstein supported defending the allied forces but generally denounced the idea of using the newly discovered nuclear fission as a weapon later with the british philosopher bertrand russell einstein signed the russelleinstein manifesto which highlighted the danger of nuclear weapons einstein was affiliated with the institute for advanced study in princeton new jersey until his death in 1955 einstein published more than 300 scientific papers along with over 150 nonscientific works einsteins intellectual achievements and originality have made the word einstein synonymous with genius
90,throughout his life einstein published hundreds of books and articles he published more than 300 scientific papers and 150 nonscientific ones on 5 december 2014 universities and archives announced the release of einsteins papers comprising more than 30000 unique documents einsteins intellectual achievements and originality have made the word einstein synonymous with genius in addition to the work he did by himself he also collaborated with other scientists on additional projects including the boseeinstein statistics the einstein refrigerator and others 1905 annus mirabilis papers the annus mirabilis papers are four articles pertaining to the photoelectric effect which gave rise to quantum theory brownian motion the special theory of relativity and e mc2 that einstein published in the annalen der physik scientific journal in 1905 these four works contributed substantially to the foundation of modern physics and changed views on space time and matter the four papers are title translated area of focus received published significance on a heuristic viewpoint concerning the production and transformation of light photoelectric effect 18 march 9 june resolved an unsolved puzzle by suggesting that energy is exchanged only in discrete amounts quanta this idea was pivotal to the early development of quantum theory on the motion of small particles suspended in a stationary liquid as required by the molecular kinetic theory of heat brownian motion 11 may 18 july explained empirical evidence for the atomic theory supporting the application of statistical physics on the electrodynamics of moving bodies special relativity 30 june 26 september reconciled maxwells equations for electricity and magnetism with the laws of mechanics by introducing major changes to mechanics close to the speed of light resulting from analysis based on empirical evidence that the speed of light is independent of the motion of the observer discredited the concept of a luminiferous ether does the inertia of a body depend upon its energy content matterenergy equivalence 27 september 21 november equivalence of matter and energy and by implication the ability of gravity to bend light the existence of rest energy and the basis of nuclear energy thermodynamic fluctuations and statistical physics einsteins first paper submitted in 1900 to annalen der physik was on capillary attraction it was published in 1901 with the title folgerungen aus den capillaritätserscheinungen which translates as conclusions from the capillarity phenomena two papers he published in 19021903 thermodynamics attempted to interpret atomic phenomena from a statistical point of view these papers were the foundation for the 1905 paper on brownian motion which showed that brownian movement can be construed as firm evidence that molecules exist his research in 1903 and 1904 was mainly concerned with the effect of finite atomic size on diffusion phenomena general principles he articulated the principle of relativity this was understood by hermann minkowski to be a generalization of rotational invariance from space to spacetime other principles postulated by einstein and later vindicated are the principle of equivalence general covariance and the principle of adiabatic invariance of the quantum number theory of relativity and e mc² einsteins zur elektrodynamik bewegter körper on the electrodynamics of moving bodies was received on 30 june 1905 and published 26 september of that same year it reconciles maxwells equations for electricity and magnetism with the laws of mechanics by introducing major changes to mechanics close to the speed of light this later became known as einsteins special theory of relativity consequences of this include the timespace frame of a moving body appearing to slow down and contract in the direction of motion when measured in the frame of the observer this paper also argued that the idea of a luminiferous aetherone of the leading theoretical entities in physics at the timewas superfluous in his paper on massenergy equivalence einstein produced e mc2 from his special relativity equations einsteins 1905 work on relativity remained controversial for many years but was accepted by leading physicists starting with max planck photons and energy quanta the photoelectric effect incoming photons on the left strike a metal plate bottom and eject electrons depicted as flying off to the right in a 1905 paper einstein postulated that light itself consists of localized particles quanta einsteins light quanta were nearly universally rejected by all physicists including max planck and niels bohr this idea only became universally accepted in 1919 with robert millikans detailed experiments on the photoelectric effect and with the measurement of compton scattering einstein concluded that each wave of frequency f is associated with a collection of photons with energy hf each where h is plancks constant he does not say much more because he is not sure how the particles are related to the wave but he does suggest that this idea would explain certain experimental results notably the photoelectric effect quantized atomic vibrations in 1907 einstein proposed a model of matter where each atom in a lattice structure is an independent harmonic oscillator in the einstein model each atom oscillates independentlya series of equally spaced quantized states for each oscillator einstein was aware that getting the frequency of the actual oscillations would be difficult but he nevertheless proposed this theory because it was a particularly clear demonstration that quantum mechanics could solve the specific heat problem in classical mechanics peter debye refined this model adiabatic principle and actionangle variables throughout the 1910s quantum mechanics expanded in scope to cover many different systems after ernest rutherford discovered the nucleus and proposed that electrons orbit like planets niels bohr was able to show that the same quantum mechanical postulates introduced by planck and developed by einstein would explain the discrete motion of electrons in atoms and the periodic table of the elements einstein contributed to these developments by linking them with the 1898 arguments wilhelm wien had made wien had shown that the hypothesis of adiabatic invariance of a thermal equilibrium state allows all the blackbody curves at different temperature to be derived from one another by a simple shifting process einstein noted in 1911 that the same adiabatic principle shows that the quantity which is quantized in any mechanical motion must be an adiabatic invariant arnold sommerfeld identified this adiabatic invariant as the action variable of classical mechanics waveparticle duality einstein during his visit to the united states although the patent office promoted einstein to technical examiner second class in 1906 he had not given up on academia in 1908 he became a privatdozent at the university of bern in über die entwicklung unserer anschauungen über das wesen und die konstitution der strahlung the development of our views on the composition and essence of radiation on the quantization of light and in an earlier 1909 paper einstein showed that max plancks energy quanta must have welldefined momenta and act in some respects as independent pointlike particles this paper introduced the photon concept although the name photon was introduced later by gilbert n lewis in 1926 and inspired the notion of waveparticle duality in quantum mechanics einstein saw this waveparticle duality in radiation as concrete evidence for his conviction that physics needed a new unified foundation theory of critical opalescence einstein returned to the problem of thermodynamic fluctuations giving a treatment of the density variations in a fluid at its critical point ordinarily the density fluctuations are controlled by the second derivative of the free energy with respect to the density at the critical point this derivative is zero leading to large fluctuations the effect of density fluctuations is that light of all wavelengths is scattered making the fluid look milky white einstein relates this to rayleigh scattering which is what happens when the fluctuation size is much smaller than the wavelength and which explains why the sky is blue einstein quantitatively derived critical opalescence from a treatment of density fluctuations and demonstrated how both the effect and rayleigh scattering originate from the atomistic constitution of matter zeropoint energy in a series of works completed from 1911 to 1913 planck reformulated his 1900 quantum theory and introduced the idea of zeropoint energy in his second quantum theory soon this idea attracted the attention of einstein and his assistant otto stern assuming the energy of rotating diatomic molecules contains zeropoint energy they then compared the theoretical specific heat of hydrogen gas with the experimental data the numbers matched nicely however after publishing the findings they promptly withdrew their support because they no longer had confidence in the correctness of the idea of zeropoint energy general relativity and the equivalence principle eddingtons photograph of a solar eclipse general relativity gr is a theory of gravitation that was developed by einstein between 1907 and 1915 according to general relativity the observed gravitational attraction between masses results from the warping of space and time by those masses general relativity has developed into an essential tool in modern astrophysics it provides the foundation for the current understanding of black holes regions of space where gravitational attraction is so strong that not even light can escape as einstein later said the reason for the development of general relativity was that the preference of inertial motions within special relativity was unsatisfactory while a theory which from the outset prefers no state of motion even accelerated ones should appear more satisfactory consequently in 1907 he published an article on acceleration under special relativity in that article titled on the relativity principle and the conclusions drawn from it he argued that free fall is really inertial motion and that for a freefalling observer the rules of special relativity must apply this argument is called the equivalence principle in the same article einstein also predicted the phenomena of gravitational time dilation gravitational red shift and deflection of light in 1911 einstein published another article on the influence of gravitation on the propagation of light expanding on the 1907 article in which he estimated the amount of deflection of light by massive bodies thus the theoretical prediction of general relativity can for the first time be tested experimentally gravitational waves in 1916 einstein predicted gravitational waves ripples in the curvature of spacetime which propagate as waves traveling outward from the source transporting energy as gravitational radiation the existence of gravitational waves is possible under general relativity due to its lorentz invariance which brings the concept of a finite speed of propagation of the physical interactions of gravity with it by contrast gravitational waves cannot exist in the newtonian theory of gravitation which postulates that the physical interactions of gravity propagate at infinite speed the first indirect detection of gravitational waves came in the 1970s through observation of a pair of closely orbiting neutron stars psr b191316 the explanation of the decay in their orbital period was that they were emitting gravitational waves einsteins prediction was confirmed on 11 february 2016 when researchers at ligo published the first observation of gravitational waves on earth exactly one hundred years after the prediction hole argument and entwurf theory while developing general relativity einstein became confused about the gauge invariance in the theory he formulated an argument that led him to conclude that a general relativistic field theory is impossible he gave up looking for fully generally covariant tensor equations and searched for equations that would be invariant under general linear transformations only in june 1913 the entwurf draft theory was the result of these investigations as its name suggests it was a sketch of a theory less elegant and more difficult than general relativity with the equations of motion supplemented by additional gauge fixing conditions after more than two years of intensive work einstein realized that the hole argument was mistaken and abandoned the theory in november 1915 physical cosmology in 1917 einstein applied the general theory of relativity to the structure of the universe as a whole he discovered that the general field equations predicted a universe that was dynamic either contracting or expanding as observational evidence for a dynamic universe was not known at the time einstein introduced a new term the cosmological constant to the field equations in order to allow the theory to predict a static universe the modified field equations predicted a static universe of closed curvature in accordance with einsteins understanding of machs principle in these years this model became known as the einstein world or einsteins static universe following the discovery of the recession of the nebulae by edwin hubble in 1929 einstein abandoned his static model of the universe and proposed two dynamic models of the cosmos the friedmanneinstein universe of 1931 and the einsteinde sitter universe of 1932 in each of these models einstein discarded the cosmological constant claiming that it was in any case theoretically unsatisfactory in many einstein biographies it is claimed that einstein referred to the cosmological constant in later years as his biggest blunder the astrophysicist mario livio has recently cast doubt on this claim suggesting that it may be exaggerated in late 2013 a team led by the irish physicist cormac oraifeartaigh discovered evidence that shortly after learning of hubbles observations of the recession of the nebulae einstein considered a steadystate model of the universe in a hitherto overlooked manuscript apparently written in early 1931 einstein explored a model of the expanding universe in which the density of matter remains constant due to a continuous creation of matter a process he associated with the cosmological constant as he stated in the paper in what follows i would like to draw attention to a solution to equation 1 that can account for hubbels sic facts and in which the density is constant over time if one considers a physically bounded volume particles of matter will be continually leaving it for the density to remain constant new particles of matter must be continually formed in the volume from space it thus appears that einstein considered a steadystate model of the expanding universe many years before hoyle bondi and gold however einsteins steadystate model contained a fundamental flaw and he quickly abandoned the idea modern quantum theory newspaper headline on may 4 1935 einstein was displeased with quantum theory and quantum mechanics a theory he had helped create despite its acceptance by other physicists stating that god is not playing at dice einstein continued to maintain his disbelief in the theory and attempted unsuccessfully to disprove it until he died at the age of 76 in 1917 at the height of his work on relativity einstein published an article in physikalische zeitschrift that proposed the possibility of stimulated emission the physical process that makes possible the maser and the laser this article showed that the statistics of absorption and emission of light would only be consistent with plancks distribution law if the emission of light into a mode with n photons would be enhanced statistically compared to the emission of light into an empty mode this paper was enormously influential in the later development of quantum mechanics because it was the first paper to show that the statistics of atomic transitions had simple laws einstein discovered louis de broglies work and supported his ideas which were received skeptically at first in another major paper from this era einstein gave a wave equation for de broglie waves which einstein suggested was the hamiltonjacobi equation of mechanics this paper would inspire schrödingers work of 1926 boseeinstein statistics in 1924 einstein received a description of a statistical model from indian physicist satyendra nath bose based on a counting method that assumed that light could be understood as a gas of indistinguishable particles einstein noted that boses statistics applied to some atoms as well as to the proposed light particles and submitted his translation of boses paper to the zeitschrift für physik einstein also published his own articles describing the model and its implications among them the boseeinstein condensate phenomenon that some particulates should appear at very low temperatures it was not until 1995 that the first such condensate was produced experimentally by eric allin cornell and carl wieman using ultracooling equipment built at the nistjila laboratory at the university of colorado at boulder boseeinstein statistics are now used to describe the behaviors of any assembly of bosons einsteins sketches for this project may be seen in the einstein archive in the library of the leiden university energy momentum pseudotensor general relativity includes a dynamical spacetime so it is difficult to see how to identify the conserved energy and momentum noethers theorem allows these quantities to be determined from a lagrangian with translation invariance but general covariance makes translation invariance into something of a gauge symmetry the energy and momentum derived within general relativity by noethers presecriptions do not make a real tensor for this reason einstein argued that this is true for fundamental reasons because the gravitational field could be made to vanish by a choice of coordinates he maintained that the noncovariant energy momentum pseudotensor was in fact the best description of the energy momentum distribution in a gravitational field this approach has been echoed by lev landau and evgeny lifshitz and others and has become standard the use of noncovariant objects like pseudotensors was heavily criticized in 1917 by erwin schrödinger and others unified field theory following his research on general relativity einstein entered into a series of attempts to generalize his geometric theory of gravitation to include electromagnetism as another aspect of a single entity in 1950 he described his unified field theory in a scientific american article titled on the generalized theory of gravitation although he continued to be lauded for his work einstein became increasingly isolated in his research and his efforts were ultimately unsuccessful in his pursuit of a unification of the fundamental forces einstein ignored some mainstream developments in physics most notably the strong and weak nuclear forces which were not well understood until many years after his death mainstream physics in turn largely ignored einsteins approaches to unification einsteins dream of unifying other laws of physics with gravity motivates modern quests for a theory of everything and in particular string theory where geometrical fields emerge in a unified quantummechanical setting wormholes in 1935 einstein collaborated with nathan rosen to produce a model of a wormhole often called einsteinrosen bridges his motivation was to model elementary particles with charge as a solution of gravitational field equations in line with the program outlined in the paper do gravitational fields play an important role in the constitution of the elementary particles these solutions cut and pasted schwarzschild black holes to make a bridge between two patches if one end of a wormhole was positively charged the other end would be negatively charged these properties led einstein to believe that pairs of particles and antiparticles could be described in this way einsteincartan theory einstein at his office university of berlin 1920in order to incorporate spinning point particles into general relativity the affine connection needed to be generalized to include an antisymmetric part called the torsion this modification was made by einstein and cartan in the 1920s equations of motion the theory of general relativity has a fundamental lawthe einstein equations which describe how space curves the geodesic equation which describes how particles move may be derived from the einstein equations since the equations of general relativity are nonlinear a lump of energy made out of pure gravitational fields like a black hole would move on a trajectory which is determined by the einstein equations themselves not by a new law so einstein proposed that the path of a singular solution like a black hole would be determined to be a geodesic from general relativity itself this was established by einstein infeld and hoffmann for pointlike objects without angular momentum and by roy kerr for spinning objects other investigations einstein conducted other investigations that were unsuccessful and abandoned these pertain to force superconductivity and other research collaboration with other scientists the 1927 solvay conference in brussels a gathering of the worlds top physicists einstein is in the center in addition to longtime collaborators leopold infeld nathan rosen peter bergmann and others einstein also had some oneshot collaborations with various scientists einsteinde haas experiment einstein and de haas demonstrated that magnetization is due to the motion of electrons nowadays known to be the spin in order to show this they reversed the magnetization in an iron bar suspended on a torsion pendulum they confirmed that this leads the bar to rotate because the electrons angular momentum changes as the magnetization changes this experiment needed to be sensitive because the angular momentum associated with electrons is small but it definitively established that electron motion of some kind is responsible for magnetization schrödinger gas model einstein suggested to erwin schrödinger that he might be able to reproduce the statistics of a boseeinstein gas by considering a box then to each possible quantum motion of a particle in a box associate an independent harmonic oscillator quantizing these oscillators each level will have an integer occupation number which will be the number of particles in it this formulation is a form of second quantization but it predates modern quantum mechanics erwin schrödinger applied this to derive the thermodynamic properties of a semiclassical ideal gas schrödinger urged einstein to add his name as coauthor although einstein declined the invitation einstein refrigerator in 1926 einstein and his former student leó szilárd coinvented and in 1930 patented the einstein refrigerator this absorption refrigerator was then revolutionary for having no moving parts and using only heat as an input on 11 november 1930 was awarded to einstein and leó szilárd for the refrigerator their invention was not immediately put into commercial production and the most promising of their patents were acquired by the swedish company electrolux bohr versus einstein einstein and niels bohr 1925 the bohreinstein debates were a series of public disputes about quantum mechanics between einstein and niels bohr who were two of its founders their debates are remembered because of their importance to the philosophy of science their debates would influence later interpretations of quantum mechanics einsteinpodolskyrosen paradox in 1935 einstein returned to the question of quantum mechanics he considered how a measurement on one of two entangled particles would affect the other he noted along with his collaborators that by performing different measurements on the distant particle either of position or momentum different properties of the entangled partner could be discovered without disturbing it in any way he then used a hypothesis of local realism to conclude that the other particle had these properties already determined the principle he proposed is that if it is possible to determine what the answer to a position or momentum measurement would be without in any way disturbing the particle then the particle actually has values of position or momentum this principle distilled the essence of einsteins objection to quantum mechanics as a physical principle it was shown to be incorrect when the aspect experiment of 1982 confirmed bells theorem which had been promulgated in 1964
90,early life and education einstein at the age of 3 in 1882 albert einstein in 1893 age 14 einsteins matriculation certificate at the age of 17 showing his final grades from the argovian cantonal school aargauische kantonsschule on a scale of 16 with 6 being the highest possible mark albert einstein was born in ulm in the kingdom of württemberg in the german empire on 14 march 1879 his parents were hermann einstein a salesman and engineer and pauline koch in 1880 the family moved to munich where einsteins father and his uncle jakob founded elektrotechnische fabrik j einstein cie a company that manufactured electrical equipment based on direct current the einsteins were nonobservant ashkenazi jews and albert attended a catholic elementary school in munich from the age of 5 for three years at the age of 8 he was transferred to the luitpold gymnasium now known as the albert einstein gymnasium where he received advanced primary and secondary school education until he left the german empire seven years later in 1894 hermann and jakobs company lost a bid to supply the city of munich with electrical lighting because they lacked the capital to convert their equipment from the direct current dc standard to the more efficient alternating current ac standard the loss forced the sale of the munich factory in search of business the einstein family moved to italy first to milan and a few months later to pavia when the family moved to pavia einstein stayed in munich to finish his studies at the luitpold gymnasium his father intended for him to pursue electrical engineering but einstein clashed with authorities and resented the schools regimen and teaching method he later wrote that the spirit of learning and creative thought was lost in strict rote learning at the end of december 1894 he travelled to italy to join his family in pavia convincing the school to let him go by using a doctors note during his time in italy he wrote a short essay with the title on the investigation of the state of the ether in a magnetic field in 1895 at the age of 16 einstein took the entrance examinations for the swiss federal polytechnic in zürich later the eidgenössische technische hochschule eth he failed to reach the required standard in the general part of the examination but obtained exceptional grades in physics and mathematics on the advice of the principal of the polytechnic he attended the argovian cantonal school gymnasium in aarau switzerland in 189596 to complete his secondary schooling while lodging with the family of professor jost winteler he fell in love with wintelers daughter marie alberts sister maja later married wintelers son paul in january 1896 with his fathers approval einstein renounced his citizenship in the german kingdom of württemberg to avoid military service in september 1896 he passed the swiss matura with mostly good grades including a top grade of 6 in physics and mathematical subjects on a scale of 16 though only 17 he enrolled in the fouryear mathematics and physics teaching diploma program at the zürich polytechnic marie winteler moved to olsberg switzerland for a teaching post einsteins future wife mileva marić also enrolled at the polytechnic that year she was the only woman among the six students in the mathematics and physics section of the teaching diploma course over the next few years einstein and marićs friendship developed into romance and they read books together on extracurricular physics in which einstein was taking an increasing interest in 1900 einstein was awarded the zürich polytechnic teaching diploma but marić failed the examination with a poor grade in the mathematics component theory of functions there have been claims that marić collaborated with einstein on his 1905 papers known as the annus mirabilis papers but historians of physics who have studied the issue find no evidence that she made any substantive contributions marriages and children albert einstein in 1904 age 25 the discovery and publication in 1987 of an early correspondence between einstein and marić revealed that they had had a daughter called lieserl in their letters born in early 1902 in novi sad where marić was staying with her parents marić returned to switzerland without the child whose real name and fate are unknown einstein probably never saw his daughter the contents of his letter to marić in september 1903 suggest that the girl was either given up for adoption or died of scarlet fever in infancy einstein with his wife elsa 1921 einstein and marić married in january 1903 in may 1904 their first son hans albert einstein was born in bern switzerland their second son eduard was born in zürich in july 1910 in april 1914 they moved to berlin after a few months his wife returned to zürich with their sons after learning that einsteins chief romantic attraction was his first and second cousin elsa they divorced on 14 february 1919 having lived apart for five years eduard whom his father called tete for petit had a breakdown at about age 20 and was diagnosed with schizophrenia his mother cared for him and he was also committed to asylums for several periods finally being committed permanently after her death in letters revealed in 2015 einstein wrote to his early love marie winteler about his marriage and his stillstrong feelings for marie in 1910 he wrote to her that i think of you in heartfelt love every spare minute and am so unhappy as only a man can be while his wife was pregnant with their second child einstein spoke about a misguided love and a missed life regarding his love for marie einstein married elsa löwenthal in 1919 after having had a personal relationship with her since 1912 she was a first cousin maternally and a second cousin paternally in 1933 they emigrated to the united states in 1935 elsa einstein was diagnosed with heart and kidney problems she died in december 1936 friends among einsteins wellknown friends were michele besso paul ehrenfest marcel grossmann jános plesch maurice solovine and stephen wise patent office olympia academy founders conrad habicht maurice solovine and einstein after graduating in 1900 einstein spent almost two frustrating years searching for a teaching post he acquired swiss citizenship in february 1901 but was not conscripted for medical reasons with the help of marcel grossmanns father he secured a job in bern at the federal office for intellectual property the patent office as an assistant examiner level iii he evaluated patent applications for a variety of devices including a gravel sorter and an electromechanical typewriter in 1903 his position at the swiss patent office became permanent although he was passed over for promotion until he fully mastered machine technology much of his work at the patent office related to questions about transmission of electric signals and electricalmechanical synchronization of time two technical problems that show up conspicuously in the thought experiments that eventually led einstein to his radical conclusions about the nature of light and the fundamental connection between space and time with a few friends he had met in bern einstein started a small discussion group in 1902 selfmockingly named the olympia academy which met regularly to discuss science and philosophy their readings included the works of henri poincaré ernst mach and david hume which influenced his scientific and philosophical outlook first scientific papers einsteins official 1921 portrait after receiving the nobel prize in physics in 1900 einsteins paper folgerungen aus den capillaritätserscheinungen conclusions from the capillarity phenomena was published in the journal annalen der physik on 30 april 1905 einstein completed his thesis with alfred kleiner professor of experimental physics serving as proforma advisor as a result einstein was awarded a phd by the university of zürich with his dissertation a new determination of molecular dimensions that same year which has been called einsteins annus mirabilis miracle year he published four groundbreaking papers on the photoelectric effect brownian motion special relativity and the equivalence of mass and energy which were to bring him to the notice of the academic world at the age of 26 academic career by 1908 he was recognized as a leading scientist and was appointed lecturer at the university of bern the following year after giving a lecture on electrodynamics and the relativity principle at the university of zürich alfred kleiner recommended him to the faculty for a newly created professorship in theoretical physics einstein was appointed associate professor in 1909 einstein became a full professor at the german charlesferdinand university in prague in april 1911 accepting austrian citizenship in the austrohungarian empire to do so during his prague stay he wrote 11 scientific works five of them on radiation mathematics and on the quantum theory of solids in july 1912 he returned to his alma mater in zürich from 1912 until 1914 he was professor of theoretical physics at the eth zurich where he taught analytical mechanics and thermodynamics he also studied continuum mechanics the molecular theory of heat and the problem of gravitation on which he worked with mathematician and friend marcel grossmann on 3 july 1913 he was voted for membership in the prussian academy of sciences in berlin max planck and walther nernst visited him the next week in zurich to persuade him to join the academy additionally offering him the post of director at the kaiser wilhelm institute for physics which was soon to be established membership in the academy included paid salary and professorship without teaching duties at the humboldt university of berlin he was officially elected to the academy on 24 july and he accepted to move to the german empire the next year his decision to move to berlin was also influenced by the prospect of living near his cousin elsa with whom he had developed a romantic affair he joined the academy and thus the berlin university on 1 april 1914 as world war i broke out that year the plan for kaiser wilhelm institute for physics was aborted the institute was established on 1 october 1917 with einstein as its director in 1916 einstein was elected president of the german physical society 19161918 based on calculations einstein made in 1911 about his new theory of general relativity light from another star should be bent by the suns gravity in 1919 that prediction was confirmed by sir arthur eddington during the solar eclipse of 29 may 1919 those observations were published in the international media making einstein world famous on 7 november 1919 the leading british newspaper the times printed a banner headline that read revolution in science new theory of the universe newtonian ideas overthrown in 1920 he became a foreign member of the royal netherlands academy of arts and sciences in 1922 he was awarded the 1921 nobel prize in physics for his services to theoretical physics and especially for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect while the general theory of relativity was still considered somewhat controversial the citation also does not treat the cited work as an explanation but merely as a discovery of the law as the idea of photons was considered outlandish and did not receive universal acceptance until the 1924 derivation of the planck spectrum by s n bose einstein was elected a foreign member of the royal society formemrs in 1921 he also received the copley medal from the royal society in 1925 19211922 travels abroad einstein visited new york city for the first time on 2 april 1921 where he received an official welcome by mayor john francis hylan followed by three weeks of lectures and receptions he went on to deliver several lectures at columbia university and princeton university and in washington he accompanied representatives of the national academy of science on a visit to the white house on his return to europe he was the guest of the british statesman and philosopher viscount haldane in london where he met several renowned scientific intellectual and political figures and delivered a lecture at kings college london he also published an essay my first impression of the usa in july 1921 in which he tried briefly to describe some characteristics of americans much as had alexis de tocqueville who published his own impressions in democracy in america 1835 for some of his observations einstein was clearly surprised what strikes a visitor is the joyous positive attitude to life the american is friendly selfconfident optimistic and without envy in 1922 his travels took him to asia and later to palestine as part of a sixmonth excursion and speaking tour as he visited singapore ceylon and japan where he gave a series of lectures to thousands of japanese after his first public lecture he met the emperor and empress at the imperial palace where thousands came to watch in a letter to his sons he described his impression of the japanese as being modest intelligent considerate and having a true feel for art because of einsteins travels to the far east he was unable to personally accept the nobel prize for physics at the stockholm award ceremony in december 1922 in his place the banquet speech was held by a german diplomat who praised einstein not only as a scientist but also as an international peacemaker and activist on his return voyage he visited palestine for 12 days in what would become his only visit to that region he was greeted as if he were a head of state rather than a physicist which included a cannon salute upon arriving at the home of the british high commissioner sir herbert samuel during one reception the building was stormed by people who wanted to see and hear him in einsteins talk to the audience he expressed happiness that the jewish people were beginning to be recognized as a force in the world einstein visited spain for two weeks in 1923 where he briefly met santiago ramón y cajal and also received a diploma from king alfonso xiii naming him a member of the spanish academy of sciences 19301931 travel to the us in december 1930 einstein visited america for the second time originally intended as a twomonth working visit as a research fellow at the california institute of technology after the national attention he received during his first trip to the us he and his arrangers aimed to protect his privacy although swamped with telegrams and invitations to receive awards or speak publicly he declined them all after arriving in new york city einstein was taken to various places and events including chinatown a lunch with the editors of the new york times and a performance of carmen at the metropolitan opera where he was cheered by the audience on his arrival during the days following he was given the keys to the city by mayor jimmy walker and met the president of columbia university who described einstein as the ruling monarch of the mind harry emerson fosdick pastor at new yorks riverside church gave einstein a tour of the church and showed him a fullsize statue that the church made of einstein standing at the entrance also during his stay in new york he joined a crowd of 15000 people at madison square garden during a hanukkah celebration einstein next traveled to california where he met caltech president and nobel laureate robert a millikan his friendship with millikan was awkward as millikan had a penchant for patriotic militarism where einstein was a pronounced pacifist during an address to caltechs students einstein noted that science was often inclined to do more harm than good einstein left and charlie chaplin at the hollywood premiere of city lights january 1931 this aversion to war also led einstein to befriend author upton sinclair and film star charlie chaplin both noted for their pacifism carl laemmle head of universal studios gave einstein a tour of his studio and introduced him to chaplin they had an instant rapport with chaplin inviting einstein and his wife elsa to his home for dinner chaplin said einsteins outward persona calm and gentle seemed to conceal a highly emotional temperament from which came his extraordinary intellectual energy chaplin also remembers elsa telling him about the time einstein conceived his theory of relativity during breakfast one morning he seemed lost in thought and ignored his food she asked him if something was bothering him he sat down at his piano and started playing he continued playing and writing notes for half an hour then went upstairs to his study where he remained for two weeks with elsa bringing up his food at the end of the two weeks he came downstairs with two sheets of paper bearing his theory chaplins film city lights was to premiere a few days later in hollywood and chaplin invited einstein and elsa to join him as his special guests walter isaacson einsteins biographer described this as one of the most memorable scenes in the new era of celebrity chaplin visited einstein at his home on a later trip to berlin and recalled his modest little flat and the piano at which he had begun writing his theory chaplin speculated that it was possibly used as kindling wood by the nazis 1933 emigration to the us cartoon of einstein who has shed his pacifism wings standing next to a pillar labeled world peace he is rolling up his sleeves and holding a sword labeled preparedness by charles r macauley c 1933 in february 1933 while on a visit to the united states einstein knew he could not return to germany with the rise to power of the nazis under germanys new chancellor adolf hitler while at american universities in early 1933 he undertook his third twomonth visiting professorship at the california institute of technology in pasadena he and his wife elsa returned to belgium by ship in march and during the trip they learned that their cottage was raided by the nazis and his personal sailboat confiscated upon landing in antwerp on 28 march he immediately went to the german consulate and surrendered his passport formally renouncing his german citizenship the nazis later sold his boat and converted his cottage into a hitler youth camp refugee status in april 1933 einstein discovered that the new german government had passed laws barring jews from holding any official positions including teaching at universities historian gerald holton describes how with virtually no audible protest being raised by their colleagues thousands of jewish scientists were suddenly forced to give up their university positions and their names were removed from the rolls of institutions where they were employed a month later einsteins works were among those targeted by the german student union in the nazi book burnings with nazi propaganda minister joseph goebbels proclaiming jewish intellectualism is dead one german magazine included him in a list of enemies of the german regime with the phrase not yet hanged offering a 5000 bounty on his head in a subsequent letter to physicist and friend max born who had already emigrated from germany to england einstein wrote i must confess that the degree of their brutality and cowardice came as something of a surprise after moving to the us he described the book burnings as a spontaneous emotional outburst by those who shun popular enlightenment and more than anything else in the world fear the influence of men of intellectual independence einstein was now without a permanent home unsure where he would live and work and equally worried about the fate of countless other scientists still in germany he rented a house in de haan belgium where he lived for a few months in late july 1933 he went to england for about six weeks at the personal invitation of british naval officer commander oliver lockerlampson who had become friends with einstein in the preceding years to protect einstein lockerlampson had two assistants watch over him at his secluded cottage outside london with photo of them carrying shotguns and guarding einstein published in the daily herald on july 24 1933 lockerlampson took einstein to meet winston churchill at his home and later austen chamberlain and former prime minister lloyd george einstein asked them to help bring jewish scientists out of germany british historian martin gilbert notes that churchill responded immediately and sent his friend physicist frederick lindemann to germany to seek out jewish scientists and place them in british universities churchill later observed that as a result of germany having driven the jews out they had lowered their technical standards and put the allies technology ahead of theirs einstein later contacted leaders of other nations including turkeys prime minister ismet inönü to whom he wrote in september 1933 requesting placement of unemployed germanjewish scientists as a result of einsteins letter jewish invitees to turkey eventually totaled over 1000 saved individuals lockerlampson also submitted a bill to parliament to extend british citizenship to einstein during which period einstein made a number of public appearances describing the crisis brewing in europe in one of his speeches he denounced germanys treatment of jews while at the same time he introduced a bill promoting jewish citizenship in palestine as they were being denied citizenship elsewhere in his speech he described einstein as a citizen of the world who should be offered a temporary shelter in the uk both bills failed however and einstein then accepted an earlier offer from the princeton institute for advanced study in the us to become a resident scholar resident scholar at the princeton institute for advanced study portrait taken in 1935 in princeton in october 1933 einstein returned to the us and took up a position at the institute for advanced study noted for having become a refuge for scientists fleeing nazi germany at the time most american universities including harvard princeton and yale had minimal or no jewish faculty or students as a result of their jewish quota which lasted until the late 1940s einstein was still undecided on his future he had offers from several european universities including christ church oxford where he stayed for three short periods between may 1931 and june 1933 and was offered a 5year studentship but in 1935 he arrived at the decision to remain permanently in the united states and apply for citizenship einsteins affiliation with the institute for advanced study would last until his death in 1955 he was one of the four first selected two of the others being john von neumann and kurt gödel at the new institute where he soon developed a close friendship with gödel the two would take long walks together discussing their work bruria kaufman his assistant later became a physicist during this period einstein tried to develop a unified field theory and to refute the accepted interpretation of quantum physics both unsuccessfully world war ii and the manhattan project in 1939 a group of hungarian scientists that included émigré physicist leó szilárd attempted to alert washington to ongoing nazi atomic bomb research the groups warnings were discounted einstein and szilárd along with other refugees such as edward teller and eugene wigner regarded it as their responsibility to alert americans to the possibility that german scientists might win the race to build an atomic bomb and to warn that hitler would be more than willing to resort to such a weapon to make certain the us was aware of the danger in july 1939 a few months before the beginning of world war ii in europe szilárd and wigner visited einstein to explain the possibility of atomic bombs which einstein a pacifist said he had never considered he was asked to lend his support by writing a letter with szilárd to president roosevelt recommending the us pay attention and engage in its own nuclear weapons research the letter is believed to be arguably the key stimulus for the us adoption of serious investigations into nuclear weapons on the eve of the us entry into world war ii in addition to the letter einstein used his connections with the belgian royal family and the belgian queen mother to get access with a personal envoy to the white houses oval office president roosevelt could not take the risk of allowing hitler to possess atomic bombs first as a result of einsteins letter and his meetings with roosevelt the us entered the race to develop the bomb drawing on its immense material financial and scientific resources to initiate the manhattan project the us became the only country to successfully develop nuclear weapons during world war ii and also remains the only country to have used them in combat against hiroshima and nagasaki on august 6 and 9 1945 respectively towards the end of the war for einstein war was a disease and he called for resistance to war by signing the letter to roosevelt he went against his pacifist principles in 1954 a year before his death einstein said to his old friend linus pauling i made one great mistake in my lifewhen i signed the letter to president roosevelt recommending that atom bombs be made but there was some justificationthe danger that the germans would make them us citizenship us citizenship certificate from judge phillip forman einstein became an american citizen in 1940 not long after settling into his career at the institute for advanced study in princeton new jersey he expressed his appreciation of the meritocracy in american culture when compared to europe he recognized the right of individuals to say and think what they pleased without social barriers and as a result individuals were encouraged he said to be more creative a trait he valued from his own early education personal life supporter of civil rights einstein was a passionate committed antiracist and joined national association for the advancement of colored people naacp in princeton where he campaigned for the civil rights of african americans he considered racism americas worst disease seeing it as handed down from one generation to the next as part of his involvement he corresponded with civil rights activist w e b du bois and was prepared to testify on his behalf during his trial in 1951 when einstein offered to be a character witness for du bois the judge decided to drop the case einstein in 1947 in 1946 einstein visited lincoln university in pennsylvania a historically black college where he was awarded an honorary degree lincoln was the first university in the united states to grant college degrees to african americans alumni include langston hughes and thurgood marshall einstein gave a speech about racism in america adding i do not intend to be quiet about it a resident of princeton recalls that einstein had once paid the college tuition for a black student assisting zionist causes einstein was a figurehead leader in helping establish the hebrew university of jerusalem which opened in 1925 and was among its first board of governors earlier in 1921 he was asked by the biochemist and president of the world zionist organization chaim weizmann to help raise funds for the planned university he also submitted various suggestions as to its initial programs among those he advised first creating an institute of agriculture in order to settle the undeveloped land that should be followed he suggested by a chemical institute and an institute of microbiology to fight the various ongoing epidemics such as malaria which he called an evil that was undermining a third of the countrys development establishing an oriental studies institute to include language courses given in both hebrew and arabic for scientific exploration of the country and its historical monuments was also important chaim weizmann later became israels first president upon his death while in office in november 1952 and at the urging of ezriel carlebach prime minister david bengurion offered einstein the position of president of israel a mostly ceremonial post the offer was presented by israels ambassador in washington abba eban who explained that the offer embodies the deepest respect which the jewish people can repose in any of its sons einstein declined and wrote in his response that he was deeply moved and at once saddened and ashamed that he could not accept it love of music einstein developed an appreciation for music at an early age and later wrote if i were not a physicist i would probably be a musician i often think in music i live my daydreams in music i see my life in terms of music i get most joy in life out of music his mother played the piano reasonably well and wanted her son to learn the violin not only to instill in him a love of music but also to help him assimilate into german culture according to conductor leon botstein einstein is said to have begun playing when he was 5 although he did not enjoy it at that age when he turned 13 he discovered the violin sonatas of mozart whereupon einstein fell in love with mozarts music and studied music more willingly he taught himself to play without ever practicing systematically he said deciding that love is a better teacher than a sense of duty at age 17 he was heard by a school examiner in aarau as he played beethovens violin sonatas the examiner stating afterward that his playing was remarkable and revealing of great insight what struck the examiner writes botstein was that einstein displayed a deep love of the music a quality that was and remains in short supply music possessed an unusual meaning for this student music took on a pivotal and permanent role in einsteins life from that period on although the idea of becoming a professional musician himself was not on his mind at any time among those with whom einstein played chamber music were a few professionals and he performed for private audiences and friends chamber music had also become a regular part of his social life while living in bern zürich and berlin where he played with max planck and his son among others he is sometimes erroneously credited as the editor of the 1937 edition of the köchel catalogue of mozarts work that edition was prepared by alfred einstein who may have been a distant relation in 1931 while engaged in research at the california institute of technology he visited the zoellner family conservatory in los angeles where he played some of beethoven and mozarts works with members of the zoellner quartet near the end of his life when the young juilliard quartet visited him in princeton he played his violin with them and the quartet was impressed by einsteins level of coordination and intonation political and religious views albert einstein with his wife elsa einstein and zionist leaders including future president of israel chaim weizmann his wife vera weizmann menahem ussishkin and benzion mossinson on arrival in new york city in 1921 einsteins political view was in favor of socialism and critical of capitalism which he detailed in his essays such as why socialism einstein offered and was called on to give judgments and opinions on matters often unrelated to theoretical physics or mathematics he strongly advocated the idea of a democratic global government that would check the power of nationstates in the framework of a world federation the fbi created a secret dossier on einstein in 1932 and by the time of his death his fbi file was 1427 pages long einstein spoke of his religious outlook in a wide array of original writings and interviews einstein stated that he believed in the pantheistic god of baruch spinoza he did not believe in a personal god who concerns himself with fates and actions of human beings a view which he described as naïve he clarified however that i am not an atheist preferring to call himself an agnostic or a deeply religious nonbeliever when asked if he believed in an afterlife einstein replied no and one life is enough for me death on 17 april 1955 einstein experienced internal bleeding caused by the rupture of an abdominal aortic aneurysm which had previously been reinforced surgically by rudolph nissen in 1948 he took the draft of a speech he was preparing for a television appearance commemorating the state of israels seventh anniversary with him to the hospital but he did not live long enough to complete it einstein refused surgery saying i want to go when i want it is tasteless to prolong life artificially i have done my share it is time to go i will do it elegantly he died in princeton hospital early the next morning at the age of 76 having continued to work until near the end during the autopsy the pathologist of princeton hospital thomas stoltz harvey removed einsteins brain for preservation without the permission of his family in the hope that the neuroscience of the future would be able to discover what made einstein so intelligent einsteins remains were cremated and his ashes were scattered at an undisclosed location in a memorial lecture delivered on december 13 1965 at unesco headquarters nuclear physicist robert oppenheimer summarized his impression of einstein as a person he was almost wholly without sophistication and wholly without worldliness there was always with him a wonderful purity at once childlike and profoundly stubborn
